The 2019 ESC (European Society of Cardiology) Guidelines for the
diagnosis and management of chronic coronary syndromes introduced
the term chronic coronary syndromes (CCS)1 to describe the clinical
presentations of coronary artery disease (CAD) during stable periods,
particularly those preceding or following an acute coronary syndrome
(ACS). CAD was defined as the pathological process characterized by
atherosclerotic plaque accumulation in the epicardial arteries, whether
obstructive or non-obstructive. Based on expanded pathophysiological
concepts, a new, more comprehensive definition of CCS is introduced:
‘CCS are a range of clinical presentations or syndromes that
arise due to structural and/or functional alterations related to
chronic diseases of the coronary arteries and/or microcircula-
tion. These alterations can lead to transient, reversible, myocar-
dial

Although stable for long periods, chronic coronary diseases
are frequently progressive and may destabilize at any moment
with the development of an ACS.’
Of note, ‘disease’ refers to the underlying coronary pathology, and ‘syn-
drome’ refers to the clinical presentation.

considered a fixed, focal, flow-limiting atherosclerotic stenosis of a large
or medium coronary artery as a sine qua non for inducible myocardial
ischaemia and ischaemic chest pain (angina pectoris). Current concepts
have broadened to embrace structural and functional abnormalities in
both the macro- and microvascular compartments of the coronary tree
that may lead to transient myocardial ischaemia. At the macrovascular
level, not only fixed, flow-limiting stenoses but also diffuse atheroscler-
otic lesions without identifiable luminal narrowing may cause ischaemia
under stress;2,3 structural abnormalities such as myocardial bridging4
and congenital arterial anomalies5 or dynamic epicardial vasospasm
may be responsible for transient ischaemia. At the microvascular level,
coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is increasingly acknowl-
edged as a prevalent factor characterizing the entire spectrum of
CCS;6 functional and structural microcirculatory abnormalities may
cause angina and ischaemia even in patients with non-obstructive
disease of the large or medium coronary arteries [angina with
non-obstructive coronary arteries (ANOCA); ischaemia with non-
obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA)].6 Finally, systemic or extracor-
onary conditions, such as anaemia, tachycardia, blood pressure (BP)
changes, myocardial hypertrophy, and fibrosis, may contribute to the
complex pathophysiology of non-acute myocardial ischaemia.7
The risk factors that predispose to the development of epicardial
coronary atherosclerosis also promote endothelial dysfunction and ab-
normal vasomotion in the entire coronary tree, including the arterioles
that regulate coronary flow and resistance,8–10 and adversely affect
myocardial capillaries,6,11–14 leading to their rarefaction. Potential con-
sequences include a lack of flow-mediated vasodilation in the epicardial
conductive arteries9 and macro- and microcirculatory vasoconstric-
tion.15

presentations (Figure 1)
In clinical practice, the following, not entirely exclusive, CCS patients
seek outpatient medical attention: (i) the symptomatic patient with re-
producible stress-induced angina or ischaemia with epicardial obstruct-
ive CAD; (ii) the patient with angina or ischaemia caused by epicardial
vasomotor abnormalities or functional/structural microvascular altera-
tions in the absence of epicardial obstructive CAD (ANOCA/INOCA);
(iii) the non-acute patient post-ACS or after a revascularization;
(iv) the non-acute patient with heart failure (HF) of ischaemic or
cardiometabolic origin. A further growing category (v) are the
asymptomatic individuals in whom epicardial CAD is detected during
an imaging test for refining cardiovascular risk assessment,16 screening
for personal or professional purposes, or as an incidental finding for an-
other indication.17 Patients may experience a variable and unpredict-
able course, transitioning between different types of CCS and ACS
presentations throughout their lifetime.

ischaemia;

angina.
Furthermore, it is important to note that CCS doesn’t always present
as classical angina pectoris and symptoms may vary depending on age
and sex. Sex-stratified analyses indicate that women with suspected
angina are usually older and have a heavier cardiovascular risk
factor burden, more frequent comorbidities, non-anginal symptoms
such as dyspnoea and fatigue, and greater prevalence of MVA than
men.18–21
management strategies
Contemporary primary prevention,16 including lifestyle changes and
guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), has led to a decline of
the age-standardized prevalence22,23 of obstructive epicardial coronary
atherosclerosis in patients with suspected CCS.24–28 As a consequence,
the diagnostic and prognostic risk prediction models applied in the past
to identify obstructive epicardial CAD in patients with suspected angina
pectoris have required updating and refinement.27,29,30 Initial use of
coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)31,32 for detect-
ing and assessing epicardial coronary atherosclerosis is increasingly
being adopted since it has shown similar performance to non-invasive
stress testing for detecting segmental myocardial ischaemia.33–35
Invasive coronary angiography (ICA), classically used to detect anatom-
ically significant stenoses, has expanded to become a functional test36
that includes refined haemodynamic assessment of epicardial stenoses,
provocative testing for the detection of epicardial or microvascular
spasm,37–40 and a functional assessment of CMD.41–43 Moreover, there
is a growing interest in non-invasive imaging methods such as stress
positron emission tomography (PET)44,45 or stress magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI),46 which allow accurate assessment of the coronary
microcirculation in a quantitative manner.
Medical therapy for CCS patients, including antithrombotic strat-
egies, anti-inflammatory drugs, statins and new lipid-lowering, meta-
bolic, and anti-obesity agents, has significantly improved survival
after conservative treatment, making it harder to demonstrate the
benefits of early invasive therapy.47 However, revascularization can
still benefit patients with obstructive CAD at high risk of adverse
events, not only for symptom relief48–52 but also to prevent spontan-
eous myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac death and, in some
groups, to improve overall survival53–56 during long-term follow-up.
Recently, revascularization through percutaneous coronary interven-
tion (PCI) was shown to provide more angina relief than a placebo
procedure in patients with stable angina and evidence of ischaemia,
on minimal or no antianginal therapy, confirming the beneficial effects
of revascularization.52
The present guidelines deal with the assessment and diagnostic algo-
rithm in patients with symptoms suspected of CCS (Section 3) and their
treatment (Section 4), special subgroups of CCS patients (Section 5) and
finally, long-term follow-up and care (Section 6).

management of individuals with
suspected chronic coronary
syndrome
Managing individuals with suspected CCS involves four steps (Figure 2):
STEP 1. The first step is a general clinical evaluation that focuses on as-
sessing symptoms and signs of CCS, differentiating non-cardiac
causes of chest pain and ruling out ACS. This initial clinical evaluation
requires recording a 12-lead resting electrocardiogram (ECG), basic
blood tests, and in selected individuals, chest X-ray imaging and pul-
monary function testing. This evaluation can be done by the general
practitioner.
STEP 2. The second step is a further cardiac examination, including
echocardiography at rest to rule out left ventricular (LV) dysfunc-
tion and valvular heart disease. After that, it is recommended to es-
timate the clinical likelihood of obstructive CAD to guide deferral or
referral to further non-invasive and invasive testing.
STEP 3. The third step involves diagnostic testing to establish the diag-
nosis of CCS and determine the patient’s risk of future events.
STEP 4. The final step includes lifestyle and risk-factor modification
combined with disease-modifying medications. A combination of
antianginal medications is frequently needed, and coronary revascu-
larization is considered if symptoms are refractory to medical treat-
ment or if high-risk CAD is present. If symptoms persist after
obstructive CAD is ruled out, coronary microvascular disease and
vasospasm should be considered.
examination
Careful and detailed history taking is the initial step in diagnostic man-
agement for all clinical scenarios within the spectrum of CCS. Although
chest pain or discomfort (Figure 3) is the most cardinal symptom of
CCS, it must be emphasized that many patients do not present with
characteristic anginal symptoms and that the symptomatology may
vary with age, sex, race, socioeconomic class, and geographical location.
In contemporary studies, only 10% to 25% of patients with suspected
CCS present with angina with classic aggravating and relieving factors,
while 57% to 78% have symptoms less characteristic of angina and
While older studies suggested that women were more likely to ex-
perience less characteristic chest pain symptoms,58 recent data show
that anginal chest pain is equally prevalent in both men and women, al-
beit with slightly different characteristics.59 Symptoms were classified as
non-characteristic angina in over two-thirds of the patients of both
sexes.21,60 Of note, the absence of anginal symptoms does not preclude
CCS, as it may be absent in patients with diabetes with autonomic neur-
opathy or in elderly patients with a very sedentary lifestyle despite very
severe obstructive CAD. Of course, chest pain is not always angina (i.e.
of ischaemic origin), since it can be related to non-coronary (e.g. peri-
carditis) or non-cardiovascular conditions.61,62
Anginal pain symptoms have been traditionally classified as “typical,
atypical, or non-anginal/non-cardiac” based on the location of the
pain, as well as precipitating and relieving factors. Although angina
that meets all three characteristics, with retrosternal chest discomfort
provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitro-
glycerine, is highly suggestive of ischaemia caused by obstructive CAD,
these characteristics are rarely all present when ischaemia is caused by
microvascular dysfunction and vasospasm. Furthermore, patients with
“typical” vs. “atypical” angina included in the PRECISE study had similar
tom classification on typicality of angina used in obstructive CAD pre-
diction models. Because this terminology to describe anginal symptoms
no longer aligns with current concepts of CCS, it should be replaced
by a detailed description of symptoms (Figure 3). It is important to
thoroughly evaluate chest pain, including an objective exclusion of myo-
cardial ischaemia caused by obstructive CAD, microvascular disease,
and/or coronary vasospasm, before classifying it as non-cardiac.

The Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification is still widely used
as a grading system for effort-induced angina to quantify the threshold
at which symptoms occur with physical activities (Table 5). Importantly,
the severity of symptoms is not well associated with the severity of ob-
structive CAD and appears to differ by sex. Women have more fre-
quent angina, independent of less extensive epicardial CAD, and less
severe myocardial ischaemia than men.63 Angina at rest is not always
indicative of severe, fixed obstructive CAD, as it may also occur in pa-
tients with transient epicardial or microvascular coronary vasospasm.
It is essential to document coronary risk factors during history taking,
as they may be modifiable and will be used for the pre-test likelihood
estimation of obstructive CAD. Smoking cessation counselling starts
with a quantitative assessment of prior and current tobacco use to
make the risk factor more evident to the patient. In addition, detailed
family history looking for premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) or
sudden cardiac death should always be obtained. If available, cholesterol
levels help define familial hypercholesterolaemia.64 It is also essential
to assess the presence of comorbidities that affect the likelihood of
CAD and overall survival. Because of their high prevalence in CCS
patients, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney dis-
ease, and peripheral and cerebral vascular disease are particularly
relevant.

Recent-onset anginal symptoms with changing frequency or intensity
should raise the suspicion that a coronary atherosclerotic plaque may
be destabilizing. In these patients, the diagnostic algorithm recom-
with acute coronary syndromes should be used to rule out an acute
event.65
When investigating suspected CCS, it is important to perform a
thorough physical examination that includes BP measurement and
hypertension, valvular heart disease, LV hypertrophy, or arrhythmias. It
is also recommended to search for evidence of non-coronary vascular
disease, which may be asymptomatic (palpation of peripheral pulses;
auscultation of carotid and femoral arteries), and signs of other co-
morbid conditions, such as thyroid disease, renal disease, or diabetes.
This should be used in the context of other clinical information, such
as the presence of cough or stinging pain, making CCS less likely.
One should also try to reproduce the symptoms by palpation and
test the effect of sublingual nitroglycerine to classify the symptoms.
biochemistry
Basic testing in individuals with suspected CCS includes a 12-lead ECG,
standard laboratory tests, resting echocardiography, and, in selected
patients, a chest X-ray, and a pulmonary function test if dyspnoea is
the main symptom. Such tests can be done on an outpatient basis.
The paradigm of diagnosing myocardial ischaemia has, for almost a cen-
tury, been based on detecting repolarization abnormalities, mainly in
the form of ST-segment depressions or T wave abnormalities. Thus,
the resting 12-lead ECG remains an indispensable component of the ini-
tial evaluation of a patient with chest pain.67
A normal resting ECG is frequently recorded after an anginal attack.
However, even in the absence of repolarization abnormalities, the ECG
at rest may suggest CCS indirectly, through signs of previous MI (patho-
logical Q or R waves) or conduction abnormalities [mainly left bundle
branch block (LBBB) and impaired atrioventricular conduction]. Atrial
fibrillation (AF) is not rarely associated with CCS.68 ST-segment de-
pression during supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, however, is not a
strong predictor of obstructive CAD.69–72
The ECG can be crucial for diagnosing transient myocardial ischae-
mia by recording dynamic ST-segment changes during ongoing angina.
Vasospastic angina (VSA) should be suspected when observing typical
transient ST-segment elevations or depressions with U-wave changes
during an angina attack at rest.73
Long-term ambulatory ECG monitoring can be considered in se-
lected patients to detect ischaemia during anginal episodes unrelated
to physical activities. ECG changes suggesting ischaemia on ambulatory
ECG monitoring are frequent in women but do not correlate with find-
ings during stress testing.74 Ambulatory ECG monitoring may also re-
veal ‘silent’ ischaemia in patients with CCS, but therapeutic strategies
targeting it have not demonstrated clear survival benefits.75,76

Laboratory blood tests identify potential causes of ischaemia (e.g. se-
vere anaemia, hyperthyroidism), cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. lipids,
fasting glucose), and yield prognostic information (e.g. renal disease, in-
flammation). When fasting plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin
(HbA1c) are both inconclusive, an additional oral glucose tolerance
test is useful.85,86
A lipid profile, including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides, allowing calculation of low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is necessary in every person
with suspected CCS to refine his/her risk profile and guide treat-
ment.16,64 Fasting values are needed to characterize severe dyslipidae-

disease;88
lipoprotein(a)-
lowering strategies are currently being investigated in phase 3 cardiovas-
cularoutcomes trials.89–91 Given that circulating lipoprotein(a) levelsare
genetically determined and do not fluctuate substantially over a life-
time,89,91 a single measure is sufficient in persons with suspected CCS.92
Renal dysfunction increases the likelihood of CAD and has a negative
impact on prognosis.93–95 Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) also impacts
renally cleared drugs. It is reasonable to also measure uric acid levels, as
hyperuricaemia is frequent, and may affect renal function.
If there is a clinical suspicion of CAD instability, biochemical markers
of myocardial injury—such as troponin T or troponin I—should be
measured, preferably using high-sensitivity assays, and management
with acute coronary syndromes.65 If high-sensitivity assays are em-
ployed, low troponin levels can be detected in many patients with stable
angina. Increased troponin levels are associated with adverse out-
comes,96–100 and small studies have indicated a possible incremental va-
lue in diagnosing obstructive CAD,101–104 but larger trials are needed to
verify the utility of systematic assessment in individuals suspected of
CCS. While multiple biomarkers may be useful for prognostication,
they do not yet have a role in diagnosing obstructive CAD, but some
promising results have been published.105–108 Measuring NT-proBNP
helps confirm or exclude suspected HF.
Markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein109–113 and
fibrinogen114–118 are predictors of an individual’s risk of CAD and can
predict cardiovascular event risk in CCS patients,99,111 but their value
is limited beyond traditional risk factors.111 However, in patients taking
contemporary statins, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was
a stronger predictor for future cardiovascular events and death than
LDL-C.119,120 These patients may benefit from additional LDL-C reduc-
tion through adjunctive lipid-lowering therapies, such as ezetimibe,
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition,121
inclisiran, and bempedoic acid.122–124 Elevated hs-CRP levels in patients
taking statins and PCSK9 inhibitors may indicate residual inflammatory
risk that could be further reduced through inflammation modula-
tion.119,125,126 Experimental inhibition of interleukin-6, a pivotal factor
in atherothrombosis, resulted in a marked parallel reduction of
C-reactive protein and fibrinogen in patients with chronic kidney dis-
ease (CKD) and high cardiovascular risk.127
atherosclerotic coronary artery disease
The diagnosis of CCS is based on interpreting the individual’s symp-
toms, balancing the impact of age, sex, risk factors, and comorbidities
on the likelihood that CCS is present, and choosing the most appropri-
ate diagnostic test to confirm the clinically suspected diagnosis. To aid
diagnosis, prediction tables for obstructive CAD can be used that inte-
grate these clinical factors and provide guidance on selecting diagnostic
tests based on their capacities to rule in and rule out obstructive
atherosclerotic CAD. Importantly, these models do not include the prob-
ability of ANOCA/INOCA, which always needs to be considered if
symptoms persist after deferral of further testing or diagnostic testing
that excludes obstructive CAD.
The tables used to estimate the likelihood of obstructive CAD as
confirmed by ICA were initially based on the Diamond–Forrester ap-
proach,

However, these tables have had to be updated several times owing
to the declining prevalence of obstructive CAD at invasive angiography
in contemporary Western cohorts.26,29 The overestimation of ob-
structive CAD prevalence has limited the utility of these tables in clinical
routine and in accurately estimating the post-test likelihood of ob-
structive CAD by diagnostic imaging methods.1,29,30

symptoms) leads to improved prediction of obstructive CAD, down-
classifies more individuals to very low and low likelihood of disease,
and maintains high calibration.30,139,140 The Risk-Factor-weighted
Clinical Likelihood (RF-CL) model includes sex, age, angina symptoms,
and number of risk factors without losing diagnostic accuracy com-
pared with more advanced models requiring computed calculation
(Figure 4).139,141,142 The RF-CL model increases three-fold the number
of subjects categorized as at very low (≤5%) likelihood of obstructive
CAD compared with the ESC pretest probability (ESC-PTP) model
(38% vs. 12%),139 while predicting annualized event rates of MI and
death of 0.5%, 1.1%, and 2.1% for individuals having very low, low,
and moderate likelihood of obstructive CAD, respectively.143
Individual adjustment of the likelihood may be necessary for indivi-
duals with severe single risk factors or comorbidities associated with
an increased prevalence of obstructive CAD, which are not reflected
in the RF-CL model, e.g. familial hypercholesterolaemia, severe kidney
dysfunction, rheumatic/inflammatory diseases, and peripheral artery
disease (PAD).
Exercise ECG testing may modify the likelihood of obstructive CAD
and can be used in patients with low (>5%–15%) clinical likelihood, in
whom a negative test allows reclassification to the very low (≤5%) clin-
ical likelihood group with a favourable prognosis.144 However, CCTA
as a first-line diagnostic test can give more accurate information and
has been associated with fewer angina symptoms during follow-up
than a strategy with exercise ECG as the first investigation.145–148 In
addition, more adverse events were observed in randomized trials
with an exercise ECG than with a CCTA-based diagnostic strat-
egy.34,146 However, exercise ECG remains clinically useful for reprodu-
cing anginal symptoms, which have a prognostic value.149,150
In contrast to exercise ECG, visualization of calcified atherosclerotic
plaque in the coronary artery significantly impacts the clinical likelihood
of atherosclerotic obstructive CAD. Coronary artery calcification
(CAC) can be measured using the coronary artery calcium score
(CACS), which is derived from an ECG-gated non-contrast-enhanced
computed tomography (CT) scan. Alternatively, the presence of
CAC can be evaluated qualitatively by visually inspecting the coronary
arteries on a previous non-cardiac chest CT scan, if available. The ab-
sence of CAC (CACS = 0) has a very high negative predictive value
(>95%) for obstructive CAD.151 Of note, in younger patients, obstruct-
ive CAD is rare, but when present, a higher percentage (58% of those
younger than 40 years) have a CACS of 0 compared with older patients
with obstructive CAD (9% among those aged 60 to 69 years).152
Small, randomized studies have shown that further testing can safely
be deferred in patients without CAC, without increased event rates
during follow-up.146,153 Finally, in a larger prospective observational
study, absence of CAC alone was sufficient to define a low-risk
group with no need for further testing with improved accuracy com-
pared with basic clinical prediction models.154 The combination of
CACS with the RF-CL model [CACS + RF-CL (the Coronary Artery
Calcium Score-Weighted Clinical Likelihood—CACS-CL)] showed
the strongest potential to effectively defer cardiac testing compared
with other clinical prediction models or CACS alone (adjustment of
the estimation of the clinical likelihood of obstructive CAD).139,154
With the CACS-CL model, substantially more individuals (54%) com-
pared with the RF-CL model (38%) were categorized as having a very
low clinical likelihood of obstructive CAD in the external validation co-
horts.139 Finally, the CACS-CL model was superior to other clinical
prediction models in predicting MI and death during follow-up.143
Detection of atherosclerotic disease in non-coronary arteries with
ultrasound or CT scans of, e.g. the aorta, and the carotid or femoral ar-
teries, may increase the clinical likelihood of obstructive CAD,155–158
and the risk for future CVD events.159,160 However, how accurately
the detection of non-coronary atherosclerotic disease impacts the like-
lihood estimation of obstructive CAD needs further investigation.
In general, individuals with a very low (≤5%) likelihood of obstructive
CAD do not require further diagnostic testing unless symptoms persist
and non-cardiac causes have been excluded. In patients with a low
(>5%–15%) likelihood of obstructive CAD, the benefit of diagnostic
testing is uncertain but may be performed if symptoms are limiting
and require clarification. Patients with moderate (>15%–50%), high
(>50%–85%), and very high (>85%) likelihood of obstructive CAD
are encouraged to undergo further diagnostic testing.
By using pre-test likelihood estimates and diagnostic imaging-test
positive and negative likelihood ratios, it is possible to calculate the
post-test probability of obstructive CAD. Hence, pre-test likelihood es-
timation is useful to guide non-invasive diagnostic test strategies for de-
tecting obstructive CAD (Section 3.3.4).

An echocardiographic study will provide important information about car-
diac function and anatomy. Patients with CCS have often preserved left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).167 A decreased LV function and/or
regionalwall motion abnormalities may increasethe suspicion of ischaemic
myocardial damage,167 and a pattern of LV dysfunction following the
anatomical perfusion territory of the coronary arteries is typical in patients
who have already had an MI.168,169 The detection of regional wall motion
abnormalities can be challenging by visual assessment, and detection of
early systolic lengthening, decreased systolic shortening, or post-systolic
shortening by strain imaging techniques,170–172 or new parameters such
as global myocardial work,173 may be helpful in individuals with apparently
normalLVfunctionbutwithclinicalsuspicionofCCS.DiastolicLVdysfunc-
tion hasbeenreported tobe anearly signofischaemic myocardialdysfunc-
tion and may also be indicative of microvascular dysfunction.174,175
Echocardiography can help in detecting alternative causes of chest
pain (e.g. pericarditis) and in diagnosing valvular heart diseases, ischae-
mic HF, and most cardiomyopathies,176 though these diseases may co-
exist with obstructive CAD. The use of an echocardiographic contrast
agent can be helpful in patients with poor acoustic windows.177
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is an alternative in patients with
suspected CAD when the echocardiogram (having used ultrasound
contrast agent) is inconclusive.178 Cardiac magnetic resonance can as-
sess global and regional function,179 and the use of late gadolinium en-
hancement (LGE) CMR can reveal a typical pattern of scarred
myocardium in patients who have already experienced an MI.180
Moreover, CMR provides information on myocardial ischaemia
through the evaluation of stress-induced perfusion defects.181
The strongest predictor of long-term survival is systolic LV function.
Hence, risk stratification through the assessment of systolic LV function
is useful in all symptomatic individuals with suspected CCS. Mortality
increases as LVEF declines.182 Management of patients with either an-
gina or HF symptoms, with reduced LVEF ≤40% or mildly reduced
LVEF 41%–49%, is described in Section 4.
Exercise ECG testing is low cost, does not use ionizing radiation, is
widely accessible, and remains an alternative for diagnostic testing de-
pending on local resources and individual characteristics.
The classical exercise ECG, involving graded exercise until the occur-
rence of fatigue, limiting chest pain or discomfort, significant ischaemic
ECG changes, arrhythmias, excessive hypertension, a BP drop or after
reaching 85% of the maximal predicted heart rate, has been the main-
stay of the examination techniques used in clinical cardiology for asses-
sing individuals with suspected CCS. Exercise ECG testing has a lower
diagnostic performance of obstructive CAD compared with modern
functional imaging and CCTA,148 which, therefore, should be preferred
as a first-line test in subjects with suspected CCS. Several clinical trials
have confirmed that a strategy based on anatomical34,146,187,188 or func-
tional imaging189 simplifies the diagnosis, enables the targeting of pre-
ventive therapies and interventions, and potentially reduces the risk
of MI compared with usual care based on exercise ECG. In addition,
two randomized trials showed that patients reported fewer anginal
investigation for stable chest pain compared with exercise ECG.145,146
Although the Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart
(SCOT-HEART) trial favoured CCTA as first-line test in CCS, a post
hoc analysis suggested that abnormal results of exercise ECG remain
a specific indicator of obstructive CAD, and are associated with future
coronary revascularization and risk of MI.188 Exercise ECG testing with
clearly abnormal results was most predictive for these outcomes; how-
ever, in a large proportion of individuals who underwent exercise ECG,
particularly those with normal or inconclusive results, there was still a
significant amount of unrecognized non-obstructive and obstructive
CAD, which can be detected by additional CCTA imaging.188 In the
WOMEN trial (What is the Optimal Method for Ischemia Evaluation
of Women), including low-risk symptomatic women, exercise ECG
was equally effective compared with exercise myocardial perfusion
scintigraphy, with a similar 2-year incidence of major adverse cardiovas-
cular events (MACE), defined as CAD death, or hospitalization for an
ACS or HF, while providing significant diagnostic cost savings.190
Individuals exercising >10 metabolic equivalents with a negative exer-
cise ECG and a low-risk Duke Treadmill Score have a good prognosis
with limited need for downstream testing and revascularization.166,191
Patients with marked ischaemia at a low workload and a high-risk
Duke Treadmill Score may benefit from further anatomical or function-
al testing. In regions with limited access to functional imaging or CCTA,
or in individuals with a low (>5%–15%) pre-test likelihood of obstruct-
ive CAD,144 exercise ECG remains, therefore, useful for risk stratifica-
tion and prognostication.144 Particularly, in subjects with a low (>5%–
to down-classify patients into the very low likelihood (<5%) class, in
whom further testing can be deferred.144
An exercise ECG is of no diagnostic value in patients with ECG ab-
normalities at rest that prevent interpretation of the ST-segment
changes during stress (i.e. LBBB, paced rhythm, Wolff−Parkinson
−White syndrome, ≥0.1 mV ST-segment depression on resting ECG,
or treatment with digitalis). In patients with known CAD, exercise
ECG may be considered in selected patients to complement their clin-
ical evaluation for assessing symptoms, ST-segment changes, exercise
tolerance, arrhythmias, BP response, and event risk.
In summary, due to its low sensitivity (58%) and specificity (62%), ex-
ercise ECG testing has low diagnostic performance for the diagnosis of
obstructive CAD148 and should mainly be used for risk stratification.

Chest X-ray is commonly utilized in the evaluation of patients experi-
encing chest pain. However, in the context of CCS, it does not yield
specific information for accurate diagnosis or risk stratification. The
test may provide assistance in assessing patients with suspected HF.
Additionally, chest X-ray may prove beneficial in diagnosing pulmonary
conditions that often co-exist with CAD, or in ruling out other poten-
tial causes of chest pain.
Ambulatory ECG monitoring can assist in evaluating patients with chest
pain and palpitations. It can also help in detecting and evaluating silent
myocardial ischaemia, as well as suspected VSA.192–194
tomography angiography
Through the intravenous (i.v.) injection of contrast agent, CCTA allows
direct anatomical visualization of the coronary artery lumen and wall.
CCTA offers a practical, non-invasive test, with proven diagnostic per-
formance in detecting obstructive coronary artery stenoses when com-
pared with ICA.32,148
Obstructive coronary stenoses have typically been defined using
visual thresholds of either 50% or 70% diameter reduction. It is
accepted that not all anatomical stenoses above such thresholds, es-
pecially those of moderate (50%–69%) stenosis severity, are haemo-
dynamically or functionally significant195 or induce myocardial
ischaemia.196 Depending on the clinical context, it may be necessary
to complement CCTA with functional data either from non-invasive
imaging techniques or from invasive angiography with fractional
flow reserve (FFR) (see Section 3.3.3.2), when the haemodynamic con-
sequence of a stenosis is deemed questionable for management
options.
While several earlier trials (publication date during or before 2016)
reported a higher rate of downstream ICA in patients receiving CCTA
compared with functional imaging,197 this was no longer observed in
more recent trials (publication date after 2016). Moreover, increased
downstream use of invasive procedures was linked to non-adherence
to guideline recommendations as these procedures were used signifi-
cantly less when the guidelines were adopted.198
Coronary computed tomography angiography-derived fractional
flow reserve (FFR-CT) can complement CCTA by providing values
of model-based computational FFR along the coronary tree.
FFR-CT has shown good agreement with invasive FFR,199 and has clin-
ical utility by reducing the number of unnecessary ICA procedures.200
However, in patients with severe disease at CCTA, FFR-CT has less
impact on patient management.201 FFR-CT does not require pharma-
cological stress, additional contrast agent injection, or radiation ex-
posure. FFR-CT, however, is not ubiquitous and depends on image
quality. Nevertheless, the rejection rate is reported to be quite low
in real-world data with newest-generation scanners.202–204
Computed tomography perfusion imaging, performed under pharma-
cological stress, has been validated against several reference stan-
dards, including single-photon computed tomography (SPECT) and

outcomes
The SCOT-HEART trial demonstrated a small but significant decrease
of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death or non-fatal MI
(from 3.9% to 2.3% during 5-year follow-up) in patients in whom
CCTA was performed in addition to routine testing (exercise
ECG).34 In a post hoc analysis of this trial, CCTA features (low-
attenuation plaque, positive remodelling, spotty calcifications, and
napkin-ring sign) conferred an increased risk of death or non-fatal
MI, although these plaque features were not independent of
CACS.210 Systematically evaluating adverse plaque features by
CCTA can be challenging due to technical limitations (spatial reso-
lution) and patient characteristics (calcifications).
A network meta-analysis of randomized trials suggested that diag-
nostic testing with CCTA was associated with clinical outcomes similar
to those with functional imaging in patients with suspected stable
CAD.197 In another pairwise meta-analysis, CCTA showed a lower
rate of MI compared with functional testing, but the absolute per
cent risk difference was small (0.4%).211
In the available randomized trials comparing CCTA and functional
testing (all testing a diagnostic strategy),33,210,212 test reporting and pa-
tient management variability could in part help explain the improved
outcomes observed in the CCTA arm of SCOT-HEART. In this trial,
CCTA findings, including non-obstructive atherosclerosis, emphasized
the need to trigger the start or intensification of medical treatment.
Increased standardization in reporting CCTA to encompass key plaque
features (accepting inherent limitations) will be warranted to systemat-
ically harvest prognostic information and help fine-tune risk manage-
ment strategies.213
tomography angiography
Generally, a slow and regular heart rate, and compliance with breath-
holding instructions are necessary to achieve good image quality.
This includes suitability to receive pre-medication (typically oral or
i.v. beta-blockers) when needed. Kidney function and allergy to con-
trast agents should be assessed prior to referral. Temporal and spatial
resolution remain technical limitations and can hinder precision in
adjudicating coronary stenosis severity. This is most problematic in
older patients with heavily calcified coronary arteries, in whom func-
tional testing may be more appropriate than CCTA. Contemporary
CT technology (64-slice technology or above) and a well-trained
imaging team can help mitigate these limitations and must be consid-
ered a pre-requisite for CCTA.
Stress echocardiography is used to detect myocardial ischaemia by
assessing regional systolic wall-thickening abnormalities (RWTA)
during stress. It relies on inducing myocardial ischaemia by increasing
myocardial oxygen demand beyond the myocardial blood supply.
Because ischaemia starts in the subendocardium, which contributes
to more than 50% of systolic myocardial wall thickening, stress testing
will precipitate wall-thickening abnormalities in the perfusion territory
of narrowed coronary arteries. Stress modalities used to increase myo-
cardial oxygen demand are exercise (treadmill or bicycle), or i.v. admin-
istration of dobutamine, or vasodilators (adenosine, dipyridamole,
regadenoson) combined with atropine (to increase heart rate ad-
equately—a major determinant of oxygen demand). Stress echocardi-
ography using demand stress has provided diagnostic accuracy and
risk-stratification capabilities similar to those obtained with other con-
temporary functional imaging testing modalities.148,223 The advantages
of stress echocardiography are that it is widely available, low-cost, can
be performed and interpreted at the bedside, rapid, free of ionizing ra-
diation, and can be repeated without safety concerns.224–227 Although
stress echocardiography is operator-dependent, which may comprom-
ise reproducibility, the technique is within reach of every cardiology
department or office. Compromised image quality, especially in obese
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects, is a significant

Ultrasound contrast agents considerably enhance the quality of diag-
nostic images obtained during stress echocardiography. These micro-
bubbles, consisting of stable gas and shells about the size and
rheology of red blood cells, can pass through the pulmonary microcir-
culation and induce a dense opacification of the left heart chambers.
The enhanced image quality and endocardial border definition by using
ultrasound contrast agents markedly improve the accuracy of stress
echocardiography.229,230 Ultrasound contrast agents may be required
in individuals with obesity and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and must be used in all cases if it is evident at baseline that all segments
may not be visible during stress. Passage of ultrasound contrast agents
through the myocardium allows assessment of myocardial perfusion
simultaneously with regional wall motion, improving the sensitivity of
stress echocardiography (better detection of single-vessel and micro-
vascular disease) and risk stratification beyond RWTA.231–235 The
use of ultrasound contrast agents during stress echocardiography for
assessing regional and global LV function is strongly recommended by
the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) and the
American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines—both class I
indications. Similarly, myocardial perfusion assessment has received a
class I recommendation by the EACVI and a class IIa recommendation
by the ASE.177,236 Ultrasound contrast agents are generally safe, but
rare cases of anaphylactic reactions have been reported.237
Measurement of the coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) based
on Doppler flow velocity recordings at rest and during stress in the
left anterior descending (LAD) artery, and assessment of lung conges-
tion through the visualization of B-lines on lung ultrasound, can easily be
added to routine stress echocardiography procedures. In a prospective
observational multicentre study, a reduced CFVR was often accompan-
ied by RWTA, abnormal LV contractile reserve, and pulmonary conges-
tion during stress, and showed independent value over RWTA in
predicting an adverse outcome.238 The inclusion of these additional
parameters in routine stress echocardiography procedures provides in-
sights on coronary microcirculatory dysfunction.
Finally, carotid ultrasound may be performed in the same session with
stress echocardiography to assess extracoronary atherosclerosis; while
this does not add value for confirming a CCS diagnosis per se, it provides
incremental prognostic value beyond myocardial ischaemia.239,240
computed tomography
Myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging relies on the myocardial uptake and
retention of a radiopharmaceutical. Technetium-99m (99mTc)-based
tracers are the most commonly used radiopharmaceuticals, whereas
Thallium 201 (201Tl) should be avoided as it is associated with higher ra-
diation exposure. Myocardial perfusion SPECT produces images of re-
gional myocardial tracer retention, which reflects relative regional
myocardial blood flow (MBF). Myocardial hypoperfusion is characterized
by relative reduced radionuclide tracer uptake and retention during vaso-
dilatation or stress, compared with the uptake and retention at rest. The
inherent need for a normally perfused myocardial reference territory al-
lowing for visualization of the myocardium with relative hypoperfusion
constitutes the main limitation of SPECT (and stress CMR), particularly
in multivessel CAD. Coronary calcium scoring from non-contrast-
enhanced CT, acquired for attenuation correction, as well as transient
ischaemic dilatation (TID) and reduced post-stress ejection fraction
(EF) are important non-perfusion predictors of severe obstructive CAD.
Ischaemia can be demonstrated by physical exercise or through the
administration of pharmacological stressors (e.g. dobutamine) or
vasodilators
(e.g.
dipyridamole,
adenosine,
or
regadenoson).
Pharmacological agents are indicated in patients who cannot exercise ad-

has been shown to provide prognostic information223,259 and to im-

Newer-generation SPECT cameras based on cadmium–zinc–telluride
(CZT)semiconductor detector technology enablea substantial reduction
in radiation dose exposure and acquisition time, as well as an increased

However, non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis not linked with is-
chaemia remains undetected by functional testing in general.
If available, assessment of myocardial perfusion using SPECT is recom-
mended in patients with suspected CCS with moderate or high pre-test
likelihood of obstructive CAD (15%–85%) or known CCS. Importantly, if
non-contrast-enhanced CT for attenuation correction is acquired, this al-
lows for additional CAC scoring, providing important information for risk
stratification even in the absence of flow-limiting coronary lesions.
Similarly to myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging, PET also relies on
radiopharmaceuticals. Contrary to SPECT, however, the radionuclides
commonly used (i.e. 13N-ammonia, 15O-water, and 82Rubidium) are
short-lived, with half-lives in the range of minutes, requiring production
of these radionuclides ad hoc for every investigation. As attenuation
correction is mandatory, PET is routinely performed in combination
with non-contrast-enhanced CT. Scans are performed during both
rest and infusion of pharmacological stressors (e.g. dobutamine) or va-
sodilators (e.g. dipyridamole, adenosine, or regadenoson).
While myocardial perfusion PET-CT produces retention images de-
picting relative differences in regional MBF similar to those from SPECT
exposure—the unique strength of PET-CT imaging is its ability to pro-
vide robust absolute quantitative measures of MBF. Measuring MBF
with cardiac PET does not increase radiation or imaging time. Several
measurements of MBF can be routinely obtained, including MBF during
hyperaemia, MBF at rest, the MBF reserve, and the relative MBF reserve,
and confer added diagnostic and prognostic value beyond relative per-
fusion assessment.262,263
Quantitative measures of MBF offer the ability to assess individuals
with known or suspected diffusely impaired MBF, e.g. with multivessel
CAD, or microvascular dysfunction.45,264 In general, PET-CT myocar-
dial perfusion imaging is associated with high accuracy for detecting
flow-limiting coronary lesions,148,258,265 and has been shown to provide
prognostic information.223,262,263 In several head-to-head comparisons,
PET-CT myocardial perfusion imaging outperformed other functional
imaging modalities.257,266–269 However, whether the superiority in diag-
nostic accuracy leads to improved clinical effectiveness and post-test
management remains to be elucidated.270 In a large retrospective study,
a low MBF reserve measured by PET independently predicted mortality
and helped identify patients with a survival benefit from early revascu-
larization with PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) beyond
the extent of myocardial ischaemia.271
Limitations of PET-CT arise from its limited availability compared with
other imaging modalities. Furthermore, methodological heterogeneity
exists, particularly regarding thresholds for abnormality of quantitative
measurements. Finally, physical exercise is challenging to perform.
If available, assessment of myocardial perfusion using PET-CT is par-
ticularly recommended in obese patients (due to the high photon en-
ergy), in young patients (due to the low radiation dose exposure),
and in those with known or suspected diffusely impaired MBF, e.g. those
with multivessel CAD or microvascular dysfunction.264 Notably, the
mandatory non-contrast-enhanced CT for attenuation correction al-
lows for additional CAC scoring, providing essential information for
risk stratification even in the absence of flow-limiting coronary lesions.
Aside from providing highly accurate and reproducible assessments of
overall cardiac anatomy, cardiac volumes, function, and tissue charac-
terization, CMR also offers the ability to assess myocardial perfusion,
which relies on the first-pass myocardial perfusion of gadolinium-based
contrast agents.
Recently,CMR methods using various parametersfor quantitative MBF
assessment have been introduced. However, the diagnostic performance
of these parameters varies extensively among studies, and standardized
protocols and software are lacking.272 Therefore, visual assessment of
perfusion defects is currently used in clinical practice. Myocardial
perfusion imaging by stress CMR combines high spatial resolution with
the absence of ionizing radiation. This has been shown to provide high
diagnostic accuracy in detecting flow-limiting coronary lesions,148,257,258
prognostic value,223,273–275 and improving patient management.178,276
Pharmacological vasodilators (e.g. adenosine or regadenoson) or stres-
sors (e.g. dobutamine) are commonly applied, as physical exercise is chal-
lenging to perform. In conjunction with a dobutamine infusion, wall
motion abnormalities induced by ischaemia can also be detected.277 Of
note,andas forallnon-invasive imagingmodalitiesused forassessingmyo-
cardial perfusion, incorporating all available imaging and non-imaging in-
formation as part of an integrative approach is mandatory. For CMR, a
multiparametric protocol, including LV function and assessment of LGE
along with myocardial perfusion, increases the ability to rule in or rule
out obstructive CAD in suspected CCS.278
Coronary magnetic resonance angiography allows non-invasive visu-
alization of the coronary arteries.279 However, CMR angiography re-
mains primarily a research tool due to limitations arising from long
imaging times, low spatial resolution, and operator dependency.
General limitations of CMR for myocardial perfusion arise from its lim-
ited availability, the claustrophobia experienced by patients, duration of
image acquisition,280 and possible contraindications to CMR [e.g. non-
conditional pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators
(ICDs)] or to gadolinium-based contrast agents (e.g. renal failure due
to the potential risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis). Finally, and con-
trary to SPECT/CT or PET-CT, stress CMR does not currently provide
information on presence or absence of coronary calcifications.
If available, and if no contraindications are met, stress CMR is recom-
mended as an option in patients with suspected CCS with moderate or
high (>15%–85%) pre-test likelihood of obstructive CAD or known
CCS, particularly if additional information on cardiac function and tissue
characterization is warranted.

Angina/ischaemia with non-obstructive coronary arteries (ANOCA/
INOCA) may be caused by transient and/or sustained impairments in
the supply–demand of myocardial perfusion. Functional disorders leading
to ANOCA/INOCA (e.g. MVA and VSA) are more common in women
than in men.298,299 A recent meta-analysis reported an overall prevalence
of MVA of 41% and VSA of 40% in selected patients without obstructive
CAD.299 However, the true prevalence in unselected patient populations
with suspected CCS remains unclear. Patients with ANOCA/INOCA
have increased morbility/mortality,300,301 impaired quality of life (QoL),
and weigh on health resource utilization. Early, accurate, and preferably
non-invasive diagnosis is, therefore, of importance.
The possibility of a microcirculatory origin of angina should be con-
sidered in individuals with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischaemia
and coronary arteries that are either normal or with non-obstructive
lesions on CCTA or ICA. Several measurements that rely on quantify-
ing blood flow through the coronary circulation are used to describe
the function of the microvasculature to identify cases of MVA.
Among the non-invasive imaging modalities, transthoracic Doppler
echocardiography has been used as a non-invasive means to measure
coronary blood flow but is limited to the assessment of the LAD artery
and is affected by high inter- and intra-operator variability.302,303
Furthermore, this modality cannot distinguish between impairment of
coronary flow caused by epicardial CAD or coronary microcirculatory
dysfunction.
A more direct and accurate microvascular function assessment is
based on MBF measurement. This is commonly achieved by PET-CT
myocardial perfusion imaging.299 PET allows for the quantification of
MBF (expressed as millilitres per minute per gram of myocardium)
and myocardial flow reserve (MFR). The latter reflects the magnitude
of the increase in MBF that can be achieved by maximal coronary vaso-
dilation conferred by vasodilators, such as adenosine or regadenoson.
Since the microvasculature primarily determines vascular resistance,
MFR measures the ability of the microvasculature to respond to a
stimulus and therefore represents small vessel function. An MFR of
less than 2.0 (2.5 for non-obstructive CAD) is often considered abnor-
across imaging modalities due to the moderate correlation among dif-
ferent MBF estimates.264
Recently, quantitative CMR has been proposed as an emerging tech-
nique for the assessment of microvascular dysfunction through MBF
quantification but is currently limited to experienced centres.275
Quantitative myocardial perfusion can also be achieved by myocardial
contrast echocardiography (MCE) through destruction–reperfusion
imaging and analysis of the time–intensity curves from different regions
of interest in the myocardium.231,233–235 Of note, MCE assesses capil-
lary blood flow, and capillaries comprise 90% of the microvasculature.
Measuring MBF at rest and during hyperaemia allows calculation of MBF
reserve, which is associated with severity of coronary stenoses in pa-
tients with stable angina. In a meta-analysis, MBF reserve had high accur-
acy for predicting flow-limiting CAD.231 However, in the absence of
obstructive CAD, reduced MBF reserve by MCE depicts microcircula-
tory abnormalities. Transthoracic Doppler evaluation of the LAD ar-
tery is also used to assess coronary flow reserve (CFR) during stress
hyperaemia and has prognostic value.238,255,305,306
In contrast, the diagnosis of VSA ideally relies on the results of provo-
cation tests in the catheterization laboratory through selective intracor-
onary acetylcholine (Ach) infusion (see Section 5.2.5.2).
It is important to note that there is only a modest correlation be-
tween the values of MBF reserve measured by different techniques
and modalities.269,305,307
Invasive coronary angiography has undergone significant advancements
over time. It is no longer just an angiographic technique that provides ana-
tomical information about the presence of coronary atherosclerosis and
luminal obstructions of the epicardial coronary arteries. It can also deter-
mine the functional consequences of these obstructions on coronary
blood flow [FFR and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR)] by direct meas-
urement of the coronary BP49,308–311 or by calculating the coronary
pressure drop across a stenosis based on two or more angiographic
projections.312 Furthermore, new technologies allow measurement of
CFR and microvascular resistance, and protocols have been introduced
for testing the presence of coronary vasospasm.36,39
Invasive coronary angiography with available coronary pressure
assessment49,308–311,313 is indicated in patients with a very high
(>85%) clinical likelihood of obstructive CAD,1 in particular those
with severe symptoms refractory to antianginal treatment, or charac-
teristic angina or dyspnoea at a low level of exercise1,47 or left ventricle
dysfunction suggesting extensive obstructive CAD.47,182,314,315
Invasive coronary angiography/coronary pressure assessment is also
indicated if non-invasive assessment suggests high event risk—e.g.
CCTA shows ≥50% left main stenosis, or ≥70% proximal LAD stenosis
with single or two-vessel CAD, or ≥70% proximal three-vessel
CAD56,182,316,317—or when any stress test shows moderate to severe
inducible ischaemia316 or when symptoms are highly suggestive for ob-
structive CAD. In all the above situations, ICA/coronary pressure as-
sessment is performed for additional risk stratification318–320 and to

Invasive coronary angiography/coronary pressure assessment may

decision-making.321–326

Performing ICA is not exempt from potential complications. Given
that femoral diagnostic catheterization has been associated with a
quiring blood transfusions,327 radial access is now the standard access
when possible. Radial access has been associated with reduced mortal-
ity and reduced major bleeding while allowing rapid ambulation.327 Still,

of the order of 0.1%–0.2%.327 The decision to perform ICA should bal-

When non-invasive stress tests are inconclusive or not performed, identi-
fying the artery responsible for ischaemia during ICA can be challenging,
especially in cases with multivessel CAD or coronary stenoses of inter-
mediate severity (typically around 40%–90% for non-left main stem sten-
oses or 40%–70% for left main stem stenoses by visual estimate). In such
cases,recordingwire-basedintracoronarypressureduringmaximalhyper-
aemia to calculate FFR or at rest to measure iFR is recommended to im-
prove risk assessment and clinical decision-making and to reduce clinical
events.318–320 This has been confirmed by large clinical outcome studies

iFR-SWEDEHEART (Instantaneous Wave-free Ratio versus Fractional

with diameter stenosis by visual assessment. In the PRIME-FFR [Insights

were haemodynamically relevant, and of the 71%–90% stenoses, 20%

dynamic relevance with high accuracy (96% correct classification). The
discordance between angiographical and functional assessment of cor-
onary stenosis severity varies with age, presence of CMD and lesion-
specific factors.338,339 Lesions in the left main or proximal LAD are
more likely to result in a significant FFR, as they supply a larger myocar-
dial mass than those in smaller arteries. As a result, the optimal angio-
graphic cut-off value for functionally non-significant stenosis is 43% for
the left main and 55% for small vessels.339 This implies that the thresh-
old for functional assessment for larger arteries should be set at 40%
diameter stenosis.
Large management studies showed that integration of FFR to ICA is
associated with treatment reclassification in 30%–50% of cases in the
R3F, POST-IT, RIPCORD, and DEFINE-REAL studies.309,313,340,341
Subsequently, many other non-hyperaemic pressure parameters
were introduced [distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure ratio
(Pd/Pa), diastolic pressure ratio (dPR), relative flow reserve (RFR)],
with good correlation with FFR or iFR, but without available clinical out-
come data. It is interesting to note that both separate and pooled ana-
lyses of the patients included in those studies reveal that ‘FFR/iFR-based
reclassification’ does not have any significant effect on the number of
patients recommended for revascularization.342
Meta-analyses of the 5-year outcome of patients managed with iFR
and FFR as part of the randomized DEFINE-FLAIR and DEFINE-
SWEDEHEART studies have reported a 2% absolute increase in all-cause
mortality in those managed with iFR.343,344 This was not associated with
any unplanned revascularization or non-fatal MI rate increase.343,344
Although it was initially hypothesized that this mortality excess could be
related to a higher proportion of ‘inappropriate’ revascularization deferral
with iFR compared with FFR (50% vs. 45%),343 it is reassuring that
iFR-based deferral is as safe as FFR-based deferral up to 5 years.345
In patients with multivessel CAD, systematic FFR measurement of all
epicardial vessels has been proposed to select appropriate therapy, but

Therefore, intracoronary pressure measurement in patients with multi-
vessel CAD should only be performed on intermediate lesions.
Several recent studies using either FFR or iFR suggest that the pattern
of pressure drop along the coronary artery (focal vs. progressive) re-
corded during a pullback is important to select patients who will benefit
more from PCI.2,348–352 Longitudinal functional vessel interrogation can
therefore be helpful in patients with serial lesions or diffuse CAD.
New 3D angiographically derived wireless coronary pressure para-
meters, such as quantitative flow ratio (QFR) or vessel fractional flow
reserve (vFFR), are at different stages of clinical investigation325,353,354
(NCT03729739) and have important features that may help to increase
the use of coronary pressure measurement during ICA significantly.
These technologies have indeed the unique advantage of providing
both distal coronary pressure measures and a coronary pressure
map along the coronary vessel without requiring the use of any pres-
sure wire. The lack of benefits shown in some recent FFR trials demon-
strates that it is not sufficient to validate such new coronary pressure
important to also show benefit in a direct comparative trial vs. angiog-
raphy. In that context, the results of the FAVOR III China study355 are
important, demonstrating an improved clinical outcome in the
QFR-guided group compared with the angiography-guided group,
driven by fewer MIs and ischaemia-driven revascularizations.
The combined measurements of pressure and flow (measured by
Doppler or thermodilution) may further reduce the number of inter-
ventions. Patients with lesions and concordant normal FFR and CFR
have an excellent prognosis. Patients with lesions and discordant results
between FFR and CFR have a similar prognosis to that of patients with
lesions and concordant abnormal FFR and CFR, treated with PCI.
Lesions with an abnormal FFR but normal CFR pertain to a good clinical
outcome up to 5 years of follow-up if left untreated.356–358 Moreover,
hyperaemic stenosis resistance (HSR), by measuring the pressure gra-
diagnostic and prognostic purposes.359,360 The recently introduced
continuous thermodilution technique for measuring absolute coronary
flow presents an alternative method for determining CFR. Additionally,
this method allows for evaluation of the microvascular resistance
function.361–364
Coronary flow capacity (CFC) integrates hyperaemic flow and CFR
and is useful for both diagnostic purposes as well as the evaluation of
the result after PCI.365–368
Intravascular imaging techniques [e.g. intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
or optical coherence tomography (OCT)] have demonstrated good
diagnostic accuracy in predicting FFR, especially in stenoses located in
the left main stem.369,370 They are reasonable options to assess left
main stenosis severity and prognosis; increasing left main plaque burden
was associated with long-term all-cause and cardiac mortality in pa-
tients not undergoing revascularization.371
While coronary pressure thresholds, specifically 0.80 for FFR and
in the case of deferring revascularization when FFR/iFR exceeds the is-
chaemic threshold,310,372 they must be considered alongside other
parameters. These include a careful assessment of the patient’s symp-
toms and the results of non-invasive stress testing to determine the
need for revascularization.
Detailed discussion of microvascular dysfunction by invasive coronary
functional testing is provided in Section 5.2.5.2. After nitroglycerine, ad-
enosine is administered to assess endothelium-independent vasodila-
tion [CFR, IMR, and hyperaemic myocardial velocity resistance
(HMR)]. Coronary flow reserve can be calculated using bolus thermo-
dilution (as baseline transit time divided by hyperaemic transit time) or
continuous thermodilution (as the ratio of hyperaemic and resting abso-
lute coronary flow), or Doppler flow velocity (hyperaemic flow velocity
divided by baseline flow velocity).307,378,379 The IMR is calculated as the
product of distal coronary pressure at maximal hyperaemia multiplied
by the hyperaemic mean transit time. Increased IMR (≥25 U) indicates
microvascular dysfunction.380,381 It is important to note that continuous
thermodilution-derived measurements have shown higher reproducibil-
ity than similar measurements derived from bolus thermodilution.382
(angio-IMR) allows microcirculation assessment without using intracor-
onary wires.383
Vasoreactivity testing explores endothelium-dependent mechanisms of
CMD and epicardial and microvascular vasomotor tone disorders.36,73,384
The most established approach for coronary vasoreactivity testing
is by intracoronary infusion of Ach, although other substances like
ergonovine have been proposed.384,385 The methodology is described
in detail in Section 5.2.5.2.2.

obstructive CAD, CACS can be considered to re-estimate the likeli-
hood of obstructive CAD.139,165,141,154 Further diagnostic testing can
also be deferred in patients reclassified based on CACS from a low
to a very low (<5%) likelihood of obstructive CAD (Figure 5).143
Conversely, if CACS is high and there are clinical findings indicating
that the RF-CL model may be under-estimating the likelihood of ob-
structive CAD, further diagnostic testing should be selected based on
the adjusted clinical likelihood and coronary calcium burden. It is im-
portant to note that patients with a very low and low (≤15%) likelihood
of obstructive CAD constitute approximately 85% of individuals with
de novo symptoms suspected of CCS.27,30,139 Most can be treated con-
servatively without the need for further testing as they have no sten-
oses or non-obstructive CAD with a very low incidence of events
during long-term follow-up.27,139,143
Individuals with a moderate or high (>15%–85%) likelihood of
obstructive CAD should be referred for non-invasive anatomical or
functional imaging to establish the diagnosis and assess the risk for
future cardiac events. There is growing support for using CCTA as a
first-line test in the group with a low or moderate (15%–50%) likeli-
hood.27,31,32,139,386 Given the low prevalence of CAD in this group of
patients and its high negative predictive value, CCTA is the most effect-
ive diagnostic method to rule out obstructive CAD. Moreover, besides
its strength in ruling out CAD, CCTA offers direct visualization of
non-obstructive CAD, which may trigger intensification of preventive
measures. The use of CCTA as a first-line test is supported by large,
randomized trials showing equivalence in health outcomes with func-
tional testing33 and even superiority compared with usual care using ex-
ercise ECG.34
In patients with a very high (≥85%) clinical likelihood of obstructive
CAD, symptoms unresponsive to medical therapy, or angina at a low
level of exercise, and an initial clinical evaluation (including echocardio-
gram and, in selected patients, exercise ECG) that indicates a high event
risk, proceeding directly to ICA without further diagnostic testing is a
reasonable option. Under such circumstances, the indication for revas-
cularization of stenoses with a diameter reduction of <90% should be
guided by coronary pressure assessment (Figure 6; Table 6).

Functional imaging should be selected as a first line test if information
on myocardial ischaemia, viability, or microvascular disease is desired.
Tests for detecting ischaemia have better rule-in power compared
with CCTA and therefore should be selected if there is a moderate-
high (>15-85%) likelihood of obstsructive CAD. Moreover, functional
imaging tests overcome the limitations of CCTA in certain groups (old-
er patients with more extensive coronary calcifications, AF, and other
situations with an irregular or fast heart rate, renal insufficiency, or io-
dinated contrast allergy), and avoid exposure to ionizing radiation in
young individuals and in those suspected of ANOCA/INOCA (Figure 7).

The discussion about which modality to use as a first-line test has
been heavily focused on the detection of obstructive epicardial sten-
oses, neglecting the relatively high prevalence of non-obstructive cor-
onary disease and ANOCA/INOCA, especially in female patients.
The current rationale behind choosing a first-line test should be to as-
sess the anatomical severity and functional consequences of coronary
disease, whether obstructive or not. In this regard, PET-CT should
be more frequently considered and its availability increased as it

Individuals in the moderate likelihood group, except older men with all
three CCS symptom characteristics, will have a likelihood of obstructive
CAD around 20%. In these, anatomical and functional testing will each re-
sult in an intermediate positive predictive value with eventually many false
positives, especially with CCTA easily overestimating stenosis severity.
Sequential testing (i.e. functional testing after CCTA, or vice versa) will
therefore be needed in many individuals to establish an accurate diagnosis
of obstructive, ischaemia-inducing CAD (Figure 8). Sequential or combined

A 70-year-old woman with four coronary risk factors and exertional dyspnoea has a pre-test likelihood of 16% (A). A normal CCTA almost com-
pletely rules out obstructive CAD with a very low negative post-test likelihood (2%).
A 55-year-old man with two coronary risk factors and all three anginal symptom characteristics has a pre-test likelihood of 27% (B). An abnormal
CCTA brings the post-test likelihood to 40%, insufficient to rule in obstructive CAD. Sequential testing with DSE performed after CCTA brings the
post-test likelihood to 82%. A normal CCTA effectively rules out obstructive CAD.
A 69-year-old man with four coronary risk factors and all three anginal symptom characteristics has an adjusted pre-test likelihood of 60% (C) (ad-
justment based on abnormalities on the resting ECG and on symptoms during exercise). A positive DSE alone has a high post-test likelihood
(± 90%). A negative DSE is associated with a 32% post-test likelihood. Sequential testing by CCTA would allow ruling out obstructive CAD
(<5% post-test likelihood).
After confirmation of diagnosis with the first line of testing, all patients
should receive lifestyle and risk-factor modification recommendations,
and disease-modifying and antianginal therapy should be prescribed.
The ISCHEMIA trial (Initial Invasive or Conservative Strategy for Stable
Coronary Disease)47 showed that an early revascularization strategy
did not yield a short-term survival benefit in patients without left main
disease nor reduced LVEF and with moderate-severe ischaemia at
non-invasive testing, suggesting that most such patients should initially
be treated conservatively with optimized GDMT. Patients can be re-
ferred for ICA if CCTA detects a ≥50% stenosis of the left main stem,
three-vessel or two-vessel disease including the proximal LAD artery
with ≥70% stenosis, or if functional imaging shows moderate or severe
ischaemia encompassing an extensive perfusion territory.
For patients with obstructive CAD and refractory symptoms despite
optimized GDMT, a referral for ICA may be considered to improve
symptoms through revascularization. Optimization of medical therapy
by combining two or more antianginal drugs can safely be obtained over
ICA.402,403 It is worth noting that in the Objective Randomised Blinded
Investigation with optimal medical Therapy of Angioplasty in stable an-
gina (ORBITA) trial, PCI did not provide short-term advantages com-
pared with GDMT in terms of reducing anginal frequency or physical
limitations.402 In the CLARIFY registry, anginal symptoms resolved in
many CCS patients over time without requiring revascularization or
changes in antianginal therapy.404
Combined anatomical and functional imaging before ICA facilitates
its planning by orientating the invasive cardiologist to perform, in the
same session, haemodynamic assessment of coronary stenoses and
ICFT to detect microvascular disease or vasospasm in individuals sus-
pected of ANOCA/INOCA, performing these tests in a single session
rather than in staged procedures.
Chronic coronary syndromes can be complicated by cardiovascular
death, ischaemic and haemorrhagic events, HF, arrhythmic events, the
development of valvular heart disease, and other comorbidities, which
are further discussed in the Supplementary data, available at European
Heart Journal online. It is recommended that all patients with newly diag-
nosed obstructive CAD or myocardial ischaemia undergo an adverse-
risk event assessment to identify those at high risk of adverse outcomes
who could benefit from revascularization beyond symptom relief. Based
on large registries and historical RCTs, a high event risk has been defined
as a cardiac mortality rate of >3% per year, intermediate event risk as
between ≥1% and ≤3% per year, and low event risk as <1% per year.405
Adverse-event risk stratification is usually based on the same clinical,
non-invasive and invasive investigations used to diagnose obstructive
CAD (see Table 14).
Clinical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG and laboratory
tests can provide important prognostic information. Assessment of
risk factors such as advanced age, diabetes mellitus (DM), or renal fail-
ure allows the identification of patients at high risk of events.406–408 Left
ventricular function is the strongest predictor of long-term survival; a
patient with an LVEF of <50% is already at high risk for all-cause and
cardiovascular death.409,410
Although the diagnostic value of an exercise ECG is limited, the oc-
currence of ST-segment depression at a low workload combined with
exertional symptoms (angina or dyspnoea), low exercise capacity, com-
plex ventricular ectopy, or other arrhythmias and abnormal BP re-
sponse are markers of a high risk of cardiac mortality.411–414
High plaque burden and coronary stenoses are well-known prognostic
markers. The ISCHEMIA trial using a cut-off of 70% stenosis on CCTA317
confirms the very old observations of the Coronary Artery Surgery
Study182 that the prognosis of obstructive CAD-related CCS is mainly
determined by the number of >70% obstructed coronary arteries or
by the presence of a left main stenosis (using for the latter a cut-off of
>50% diameter stenosis on coronary angiography).317 More recently,
the classical paradigm that the severity of stenoses and the number of dis-
eased vessels are the main determinants of prognosis has been challenged
by post hoc analyses of the SCOT-HEART trial and other CCTA-based

registries showing that plaque burden and presence of adverse plaque
characteristics, especially low-attenuation plaque, are the strongest pre-
dictors of fatal and non-fatal MI above the classical risk factors, including
stenosis severity.210,415–417 These findings emphasize a major advantage
of anatomical imaging by CCTA as an initial test in selected patients, al-
lowing the assessment of severity and extent of obstructive CAD as
well as coronary plaque characteristics.
Regarding the prognostic impact of inducible myocardial ischaemia
by functional stress imaging, the evidence remains conflicting. While
there are extensive data from large observational studies315,418–425
consistently demonstrating a robust prognostic value conferred by
the extent of inducible ischaemia as detected by functional imaging

and
ISCHEMIA317 trials showed that only CAD severity, but not ischaemia
severity, was independently predictive of long-term mortality and MI
risk. These discrepancies may be explained by selection and entry biases
between registries and RCTs.428 Registries typically report on all-
comer populations with suspected CCS referred for diagnostic testing
and/or revascularization, representing the real-life scenario. RCTs usu-
ally include only a very selected group of patients, and the external ap-
plicability of their findings is always open for debate. As COURAGE and
ISCHEMIA selectively included only patients with functionally moderate
or severe myocardial ischaemia but without any information on CAD
anatomical severity, it becomes harder to demonstrate a prognostic ef-
fect of myocardial ischaemia, and the anatomical burden becomes the
prominent prognostic factor. The PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter
Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) trial, which included pa-
tients more representative of an all-comer population, demonstrated
that CCTA, mainly by detecting non-obstructive CAD, outperformed
functional testing in predicting outcomes, emphasizing the prognostic
significance of imaging coronary atherosclerosis beyond myocardial is-
chaemia.208 However, adding the Framingham Risk Score to the func-
tional test result improved its prognostic value, making the difference
with anatomical testing insignificant. Both modalities are thus equivalent
for detecting CCS symptoms and predicting outcomes when consider-
ing risk factors.
Besides imaging coronary atherosclerosis, the additional benefit of ICA
is the ability to perform intracoronary pressure measurements. While
FFR of ≤0.8 and iFR of ≤0.89 have been associated with a higher risk of
vessel-related cardiovascular events, it is important to remember that a
lower FFR/iFR reflects more profound ischaemia in the vessel territory
and is associated with a progressive and proportional increase in
risk.318,319 A similar observation has been made with FFR-CT.401 It has
also been shown that for any given FFR value, a more proximal lesion is
associatedwithmoreextensiveischaemiaandanincreasedriskofaclinical

in each of the three main coronary vessel territories as a single patient-
overall cardiovascular risk; patients with a borderline FFR but with a global
FFR of <2.72 showed a significantly increased risk compared with higher
global-FFR patients.430,431 One of the main limitations of such a global in-
tegrative approach based on invasive coronary pressure is that it requires
advancing a pressure wire in each of the three coronary arteries, which is
not often performed341 and is not recommended as a routine, based on
the RIPCORD2347 and FUTURE results.346 Recent methods using 3-di-
mensional image reconstruction and computational fluid dynamics enable
FFR estimation with CCTA432 or with ’wire-less’ invasive coronary
angiography.433,434 This allows a less invasive, easier and more accurate
global FFR calculation, provided imaging is of sufficiently good
quality.369–371
In summary, when assessing event risk, clinicians should choose an
integrative approach, considering risk factors, comorbidities, LV dys-
function, the severity of myocardial ischaemia, the number of function-
ally significantly stenotic coronary arteries, and the coronary plaque
burden and characteristics, as all of these are likely interrelated factors
that affect overall prognosis.
Initial therapy frequently starts during the diagnostic process. In indivi-
duals with a high suspicion of CCS, sublingual nitroglycerine is frequent-
ly prescribed to treat anginal pain symptoms. Rapid relief within 1 or 2

min of chest discomfort after sublingual nitroglycerine increases the
likelihood of CCS. Patients may be advised to refrain from strenuous
physical activities before the diagnostic process is completed and
should be instructed what to do if prolonged anginal chest pain indica-
tive of acute MI arises.
Guideline-directed management and therapy are started during or
after the diagnostic process is concluded. The main goals of treating
CCS are to improve both QoL and life expectancy. This involves vari-
ous interventions to reduce the risk of (i) cardiac mortality, (ii) non-fatal
ischaemic events, (iii) progression of epicardial and/or microvascular
chronic coronary disease, and (iv) symptoms and limitations caused
by CCS. When deciding on treatment options, it is important to con-
medications, and healthcare costs. In shared decision-making with pa-
tients, clinicians should clearly explain that certain treatments can alle-
viate symptoms, while others can reduce the likelihood of ischaemic
events.
optimization for risk-factor control,
and exercise therapy
In CCS patients, education on risk factors and symptom management is
associated with improvements in knowledge, self-care, and patient
empowerment, and may improve health-related QoL.436 In addition,
education can facilitate long-term adherence to lifestyle interven-
tions.437,438 Educational programmes—either alone or as a core compo-
nent of multidisciplinary care management programmes—promote
patients’ awareness of their condition and the rationale for lifestyle inter-
ventions. However, awareness of CVD risk factors through education
alone might be insufficient for adoption of healthy behaviour.439
Therefore, self-care programmes are needed to enable patients to have
a major role in coping with their condition and accepting their prescribed
treatment.440,441 Elements in patient education include (modifiable) risk
factors in relation to individual cardiovascular risk, since risk perception
is an integral part of many major health behaviour theories, ultimately
leading to modification of human habits.441,442
Information on benefits of risk-factor control on recurrence risk, dis-
ease progression, complications, and overall survival should be dis-
cussed. The format, time horizon, and outcome used for risk
estimation influence patient perceptions and should be considered
when designing risk communication tools.443–445
Lifelong education for patient-centred information and problem-
based learning is superior to home-sent information in improving risk-
factor control in the long term.438,444 Refer to Section 6.2.1 for further
guidance on patient education.
control
Reducing CVD risk at the individual level begins with effective informa-
tion on risk and anticipated risk reduction by treatment. Risk algorithms
are available for use in clinical practice by means of interactive tools on-
line. The use of the Smart risk score (U-prevent.com) is suggested by
the European Association of Preventive Cardiology for risk estimation
in patients with previous CVD.446 Ideally, patients are made aware of
their individual risks and the potential benefit of prevention treatments
and then actively engaged in managing their disease. Treatment goals
are communicated using a patient-centred approach (Table 7).

Smoking cessation in CCS patients improves prognosis, with a reported
with those who continue to smoke.447 Measures to promote smoking ces-
sation include brief advice, counselling and behavioural interventions, and
pharmacological therapy.448,449 Patients should also avoid passive smoking.
Drug support to assist in smoking cessation should be considered in
all smokers who are ready to undertake this action. Nicotine-
replacement therapy, bupropion, or varenicline are effective,450,451
and are not linked to an increase in MACE.452
The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), as an alternative to con-
ventional cigarettes, should be discouraged because they are not harm-
free.453 Newer devices deliver higher nicotine contents, and e-cigarettes
emit other constituents, such as carbonyls, and fine and ultrafine particu-
lates.454 Evidence from several studies indicates that acute inhalation of
e-cigarettes leads to negative changes in vascular endothelial func-
tion.453,454 E-cigarettes should only be considered to aid tobacco cessa-
tion alongside a formal tobacco cessation programme.453,455,456
Various substances, including cocaine, opioids, and marihuana can
have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and have a potential
for drug–drug interactions with cardiovascular medication.457–459
Single-question screening for unhealthy drug use has been validated
in primary care and can identify individuals requiring counselling on ad-
verse cardiovascular effects.460
In a population-based study, lifetime risk of incident CVD, and cardiovas-
cular morbidity and mortality, were higher in those who were overweight
or obese compared with those with a normal BMI (18.5–24.9 kg/m2).461
Compared with normal BMI, among middle-aged men and women,
competing hazard ratios (HR) for incident CVD were 1.21 [95%
confidence interval (CI), 1.14–1.28] and 1.32 (95% CI, 1.24–1.40), respect-
ively, for overweight (BMI of 25.0–29.9 kg/m2), 1.67 (95% CI, 1.55–1.79)
and 1.85 (95% CI, 1.72–1.99) for obesity (BMI of 30.0–39.9 kg/m2),
and 3.14 (95% CI, 2.48–3.97) and 2.53 (95% CI, 2.20–2.91) for mor-
bid obesity (BMI of ≥40.0 kg/m2). Obesity was associated with a
shorter overall lifespan, and being overweight was associated with
developing CVD at an earlier age.461 In subjects with CAD, intention-
al weight loss is associated with a significantly lower risk of adverse
clinical outcomes,462 and has beneficial effects on risk-factor control
and QoL.463 Healthy diets with energy intake limited to the amount
needed to obtain and maintain a healthy weight (BMI of 18.5–25 kg/m2),
and combined with increasing physical activity, are recommended for
weight management.16 If weight targets are not reached, pharmaco-
logical treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor ago-
nists may be considered for further weight reduction (Section 4.3.4).

sulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist, compared

effect that was confirmed in the SURMOUNT-2 trial.467 Bariatric surgery
in severe obesityappears to be a safe and effective intervention for further
weight loss in CCS patients.468
Cardiac rehabilitation programmes should include weight-loss inter-
ventions to reach a healthy weight as a specific component. The incre-
mental
value

and
pharmacological
interventions need full consideration in secondary prevention.469
Dietary habits influence cardiovascular risk, mainly through risk factors
such as lipids, BP, body weight, and DM. It is recommended to adopt a
Mediterranean or similar diet to lower the risk of CVD, as described in
practice.16 If alcohol is consumed, it should be limited to <100 g/week
or 15 g/day, since alcohol intake of >100 g/week is associated with higher
all-causeandotherCVDmortalityinlargeindividual-datameta-analyses.470
A recent genetic analysis showed that the causal association between
light-to-moderate levels of alcohol intake and lower cardiovascular risk is
possibly mediated by confounding lifestyle factors, therefore questioning
the previously observed cardioprotective role of light alcohol use.471
Psychosocial stress, depression, and anxiety are associated with worse
cardiovascular outcomes, and make it difficult for patients to make posi-
tive changes to their lifestyles or adhere to a therapeutic regimen.
Therefore, assessment for psychosocial risk factors is recommended
in secondary prevention.16 Clinical trials have shown that psychological
(e.g. counselling and/or cognitive behavioural therapy) and pharmaco-
logical interventions have a beneficial effect on depression, anxiety,
and stress, with some evidence of a reduction in cardiac mortality
and events compared with placebo (see Section 6.1.2).472
Physical activity reduces the risk of many adverse health outcomes and risk
factors in all ages and both sexes. There is an inverse relationship between
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and all-cause mortality, cardiovascu-
lar mortality, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).473 The
reduction in risk continues across the full range of physical activity volumes,
and the slope of risk decline is steepest for the least active individuals.474
Adults are recommended to perform at least 150–300 min per week of
moderate-intensity physical activity, or 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity
physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both, spread throughout
the week.473 Additional benefits are gained with even more physical activ-
ity.475 Practising physical activity should still be encouraged in individuals un-
able to meet the minimum. In sedentary individuals, a gradual increase in
activity level is recommended.476 Physical activity can be incorporated flex-
ibly, either daily or limited to specific days. Activity patterns limited to 1–2
sessions per week but meeting recommended levels of physical activity
have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality (HR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.62–
(HR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73–0.94) when compared with inactive partici-
pants.477 Physical activity accumulated in bouts of even <10 min is asso-
ciated with favourable outcomes, including mortality.478
High levels of time spent sedentary is associated with an increased
risk for several major chronic diseases and mortality.479 For physically
inactive adults, light-intensity physical activity, even as little as 15 min a
day, is likely to produce benefits.479
Exercise training, either alone or in the context of multidisciplinary,
exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, leads to reduction in hospitaliza-
tions, adverse cardiovascular events, mortality rates, and improved
CVD risk profile in patients with ASCVD.480–483 Therefore, exercise
is a therapy that should be offered to every CCS patient in the setting
of secondary disease prevention.16
Exercise training should be individually prescribed according to the
FITT (frequency, intensity, time, type) model for aerobic and resistance
training.484
For aerobic training (walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, etc.), an ex-
ercise frequency of at least 3 days/week, preferably 6–7 days/week, at
moderate or moderate-to-high intensity is recommended. Relative in-
tensity is determined based on an individual’s maximum (peak) effort,
e.g. percentage of cardiorespiratory fitness (%VO2 max), percentage
of maximum (peak) heart rate (%HRmax) or ventilatory thresholds
(VT1 and VT2).485 To date, there is insufficient evidence to promote
high-intensity interval training over moderate-intensity continuous
training; nevertheless, optimizing total energy expenditure (either by
increasing intensity or total exercise volume) is related to greater
favourable changes in cardiovascular risk and physical fitness.486
Moderate-intensity continuous training is the most feasible and cost-
effective
aerobic
training
modality
for
patients
with
CCS.
High-intensity interval training can be prescribed in selected patients
for specific targets of intervention (e.g. to increase VO2 peak).485
Resistance exercise in addition to aerobic training is associated with
lower risks of total cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.16 The
suggested prescription is one to three sets of 8–12 repetitions, at the
intensity of 6%–80% of the individual’s one-repetition maximum, at a
frequency of at least 2 days per week, using a variety of 8–10 different
exercises involving each major muscle group.16,484
Exercise is contraindicated in patients with refractory/unstable angina
and other high-risk cardiovascular conditions (e.g. high-grade arrhyth-
mias, decompensated HF, severe aortic dilatation, active thrombo-
embolic disease). In non-cardiac unstable conditions (e.g. active infection,
uncontrolled diabetes, end-stage cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation), exercise is contraindicated. Maintenance of the
prescribed exercise regimen is crucial. According to a meta-regression
analysis, no single exercise component predicts mortality outcomes,
whereas the largest reductions in total and cardiovascular mortality
were seen in post-cardiac rehabilitation patients with the highest adher-
ence rate.487 In addition, continuation of the exercise therapy (Phase III
cardiac rehabilitation) is recommended as it will result in increased/main-
tained functional capacity, QoL, and physical activity levels.488
Sharing decision-making and offering a personalized prescription,
(age, concomitant diseases, leisure and working habits, logistical re-
straints), is recommended to increase long-term adherence.489 In add-
ition, smartphone applications490 and wearable activity trackers491 may
assist in long-term adherence to physical activity goals and exercise
therapy (see Section 6.2.1.3).492
Home-based cardiac rehabilitation with or without telemonitoring
may increase participation and be as effective as centre-based cardiac
rehabilitation.493 Telehealth interventions are more effective than no
intervention and may also complement conventional cardiac rehabilita-
tion.494,495 Also, mobile device-based healthcare (mHealth) delivery
through smartphones may be as effective as traditional centre-based
cardiac
rehabilitation,
showing

improvements
in
health-related QoL.496
Small, single-centre studies on exercise training in patients with
INOCA show that it is feasible and improves cardiorespiratory function
and QoL.497 Larger trials are needed to determine the optimal rehabili-
tation protocols and define its long-term benefits.
In patients with CCS, antianginal medical therapy aims to control symp-
toms while ensuring acceptable tolerability and patient adherence.
Several factors should be considered for the selection of antianginal
medical therapy. First, there is no robust evidence from direct compar-
isons that some antianginal drugs are more effective than others for im-
proving symptoms.504,505 There have been no large randomized trials
comparing head-to-head the historically first approved antianginal
medications [i.e. beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers (CCBs)]
vs. newer anti-ischaemic drugs (ivabradine, nicorandil, ranolazine,
trimetazidine);504,506 the latter have been tested in smaller trials assessing
non-inferiority compared with beta-blockers507 or CCBs,508 or in a lar-
ger trial as add-on therapy with a background of beta-blockers and/or
CCBs.508,509 Moreover, there is no evidence that any antianginal medi-
cation may improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes, except beta-
blockers if administered within 1 year after an acute MI.510 Second,
many patients require a combination of anti-ischaemic drugs to ad-
equately control symptoms.511 It remains unclear whether upfront
combination therapy with two antianginal drugs is preferable to mono-
therapy, or which combinations of antianginal classes may be better

than others for improving angina symptoms. Third, in any given patient,
myocardial ischaemia and angina symptoms may be caused by various
underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, alone or in combin-
ation;6,512 these may include obstruction of epicardial coronary arter-
ies, vasospasm, and endothelial/microvascular dysfunction. Based on
their mechanisms of action, different classes of antianginal drugs may
be preferable (as initial therapy or as part of combination therapy)
for patients with myocardial ischaemia of predominantly obstructive,
vasospastic, or microvascular origin.513
The current empirical paradigm for the selection of antianginal med-
ical therapy has consisted of a hierarchical, stepwise approach including
first-line (beta-blockers, CCBs) and second-line drugs (long-acting ni-
trates, nicorandil, ranolazine, ivabradine, trimetazidine).1,514 This task
force reinforces the concept that medical therapy for symptom control
in CCS should be tailored to each patient’s haemodynamic profile (BP,
heart rate), comorbidities (particularly presence of HF), concomitant
ing into account the pathophysiological basis of myocardial ischaemia in
each patient, as well as local availability of different drugs.515,516 For
many patients with CCS, initial drug therapy should include a beta-
blocker and/or a CCB. Other antianginal drugs (long-acting nitrates,
ivabradine, nicorandil, ranolazine, trimetazidine) can be added on top
of a beta-blocker and/or a CCB, or as a part of initial combination ther-
apy in appropriately selected patients (Figure 9).
Regardless of the initial strategy, response to initial antianginal therapy
should be reassessed, and treatment should be adapted if adequate an-
gina control is not achieved or if the initial treatment is poorly tolerated.
A review of the antianginal agents that can be used in the medical
treatment of CCS can be found in the Supplementary data.
Beta-blockers can be used for symptomatic relief of angina, or to im-
prove prognosis in some patients with CCS. If used for antianginal pur-
poses, the aim should be to lower resting heart rate to 55–60 beats per
minute (b.p.m.).517,518
Beyond improving symptoms, the clinical benefit of beta-blockers in
patients with CAD without prior MI and with normal LVEF is largely un-
known in the absence of evidence from RCTs. The main findings of
some observational studies addressing this issue are summarized in
the Supplementary data.
The clinical benefit of beta-blockers in post-ACS patients with reduced
LVEF is supported by solid evidence.519–521 However, there are no large
RCTs supporting the prescription of beta-blockers after uncomplicated
ACS in patients with LVEF >40%.522 The evidence provided by

observational studies andmeta-analyses isconflicting (some suggest an as-
sociation between beta-blockers and better clinical outcomes, whereas
others show a lack of association).521,523–526 There have been only two
open-label trials testing the efficacy of beta blockers in post-MI patients
(NCT03278509 and NCT01155635), though both trials were under-
powered to yield solid conclusions.527 To further elucidate the benefit
of beta-blockers in this clinical scenario, three European pragmatic, pro-
spective, large-scale RCTs recruiting post-ACS patients with preserved
LVEF to receive beta-blockers or control treatment are currently under-
way.522,528–530
The duration of beta-blocker therapy, in the long run, is a matter of
debate, particularly in patients with prior MI and preserved LVEF.531
Evidence from RCTs assessing beta-blockers rarely goes beyond a
few years of follow-up, but patients are often given continuous treat-
ment up to old age.531 Observational data are also conflicting in this re-
gard. One study has suggested that the clinical benefit of beta-blockers
their discontinuation at 1 year was not associated with higher 5-year
mortality.532 In contrast, a Swedish study starting the follow-up 1
year after the ACS episode has shown a lack of association between
the use of beta-blockers and a composite of all-cause mortality, MI, un-
scheduled revascularization, or hospitalization for HF.533 Another study
has shown that the discontinuation of beta-blockers beyond 1 year
after acute MI was associated with an increased risk of a composite
of death or readmission for ACS, but not of all-cause mortality.534
The impact of beta-blocker withdrawal 6–12 months after uncompli-
cated ACS in patients with LVEF ≥40% is being tested in two large-scale
RCTs (NCT03498066, NCT04769362.535
The aim of antianginal medications is to ensure adequate relief of angina
symptoms in patients with CCS, in part independently of their effect or
lack of effect on MACE. Initiation of monotherapy, with subsequent es-
calation to a combination of antianginal drugs in the case of inadequate
relief of symptoms, is a reasonable approach. In this context, the empir-
ical approach of starting with a beta-blocker can be recommended in
many patients with CCS, unless there are contraindications or other
drugs are more suitable instead of beta-blockers (e.g. patients with
low heart rate and/or BP). If a combination of antianginal drugs is re-
quired, the selection of the most appropriate drugs should be individua-
lized and determined by the haemodynamic profile, comorbidities, and
tolerability. The combination of a beta-blocker with a dihydropyridine
CCB is appropriate for most patients, whereas the addition of other
antianginal drugs (long-acting nitrates, ranolazine, nicorandil, trimetazi-
dine, or ivabradine in patients with LV systolic dysfunction) can be con-
sidered when treatment with
a
beta-blocker and/or
CCB is
contraindicated or poorly tolerated, or when angina symptoms are in-
adequately controlled.

blockers are not indicated in the presence of sick sinus syndrome or

Prevention of coronary ischaemic events is based on lowering the risk
of coronary artery occlusion and consequent ACS. Medical event-
preventing
therapies
include
antithrombotic,
lipid-lowering,
anti-RAAS (renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system), anti-inflammatory,
and metabolic-acting agents.
The standard antithrombotic treatment of patients with epicardial ath-
erosclerotic CAD is single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), typically with as-
pirin. In patients with ACS or post-PCI, standard treatment is dual
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and an oral P2Y12 inhibitor,
for a duration of 12 months after ACS (with or without PCI)65 or
DAPT is usually replaced by SAPT at some point. Several recent trials
have investigated shortened DAPT durations and P2Y12 inhibitor
monotherapy post-PCI to reduce the risk of bleeding. On the other
hand, in CCS patients with persistently high ischaemic risk and low
bleeding risk, extended intensified antithrombotic therapy should be
considered. Ultimately, the choice and duration of antithrombotic regi-
mens largely depend on the delicate balance between each individual’s
ischaemic and bleeding risks.
The mechanisms of action of the most commonly used antithrombo-
tic drugs in CCS patients are depicted in Figure 10.

daily) is the traditional drug of choice in patients with CCS, with or
without prior MI.557,558 In an individual-patient data meta-analysis of
secondary prevention trials (43 000 patient-years), aspirin vs. no aspirin
significantly reduced the combined risk of non-fatal MI, non-fatal ischae-
mic stroke, or death from vascular causes [from 8.2% to 6.7% per year
(P < .0001), with relative risk (RR) reductions of 31%, 22%, and 9%, re-
spectively], translating into 15 fewer fatal and non-fatal serious vascular
events for every 1000 patients treated for 1 year.558 Aspirin allocation
increased major gastrointestinal (GI) and extracranial bleeds, from
in haemorrhagic stroke but reductions of about a fifth in total stroke
(from 2.54% to 2.08% per year, P = .002) and in coronary events
(from 5.3% to 4.3% per year, P < .0001).
Thus, for secondary prevention, the reduction of ischaemic events
with aspirin outweighs serious bleeding events.557,558 There is no evi-
dence of different aspirin effects in women and men.558,559 Daily aspirin
doses of 75–100 mg seem to be as effective as higher doses for long-
term treatments.558–561
Clopidogrel
monotherapy. In
addition
to
the
cyclooxygenase-I pathway inhibited by aspirin, the platelet P2Y12 recep-
tor also plays a pivotal role in arterial thrombus formation and is the
target for three oral platelet inhibitors: clopidogrel, prasugrel, and
ticagrelor. The relative efficacy and safety of clopidogrel compared
with aspirin for secondary prevention in CCS patients has been tested
in multiple randomized trials that, taken together, have involved over
In an overall population of 19 185 patients with either previous MI
(within 35 days), stroke (within 6 months), or PAD, followed for a
mean of 1.9 years, the CAPRIE trial (Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in
Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events) demonstrated a small benefit in is-
chaemic events (RR reduction of 8.7%) with clopidogrel 75 mg/day vs.
aspirin 325 mg/day.564
In the recent, open-label, South Korean, non-inferiority HOST-EXAM
(Harmonizing Optimal Strategy for Treatment of Coronary Artery
Stenosis-EXtended Antiplatelet Monotherapy) trial, clopidogrel was
compared with low-dose aspirin in 5530 patients after 6–18 months of
uneventful DAPT post-PCI (72% initial ACS, 28% initial CCS).565
Relative to aspirin, clopidogrel reduced the composite of all-cause death,
non-fatal MI, readmission attributable to ACS, stroke, and BARC
(Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) ≥3 bleeding from 7.7% to
at 5.8 years, in a post hoc, per-protocol, post-trial analysis.566
A very recent individual patient-level meta-analysis examined seven
trials involving 24 325 patients (including recent ACS, post-CABG, or
initial CCS patients) randomized to either aspirin monotherapy
(12 147 patients) or P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy [clopidogrel in 7545
(62.0%), ticagrelor in 4633 (38.0%)] and followed for 6–36 months.562
P2Y12 inhibitors reduced the combined ischaemic outcome of cardio-
vascular death, MI, and stroke compared with aspirin (in doses of 100
or 325 mg daily), mainly through reduction of infarction. The risk of ma-
jor bleeding was similar, whereas GI bleeding and haemorrhagic stroke
occurred less frequently with a P2Y12 inhibitor. The treatment effect
was consistent across pre-specified subgroups (ACS or CCS) and
type of P2Y12 inhibitor.562
The above overall evidence supports clopidogrel monotherapy as an
effective and safe alternative to aspirin monotherapy for long-term sec-
ondary prevention in patients with CCS.
clopidogrel is more effective and displays less variable platelet inhib-
ition,567,568 although with greater bleeding potential,569 ticagrelor
monotherapy has been compared with aspirin monotherapy for sec-
ondary prevention in CCS patients treated with PCI.

based DAPT for an additional 12 months significantly reduced the

In summary, for long-term secondary prevention in CCS patients

ALPHEUS
(Assessment of Loading with the P2Y12 Inhibitor Ticagrelor or
Clopidogrel to Halt Ischemic Events in Patients Undergoing Elective
Coronary Stenting) trial results demonstrating, in 1883 patients followed
for 30 days, that ticagrelor did not significantly reduce PCI-related MI or
major myocardial injury, while minor bleeding was significantly increased
compared with clopidogrel.583
In the THEMIS trial (The Effect of Ticagrelor on Health Outcomes in
diabEtes Mellitus patients Intervention Study) of 19 220 CCS patients aged
≥50 years, with type 2 DM and no previous MI or stroke (58% with prior
PCI), ticagrelor plus low-dose aspirin marginally reduced ischaemic events
compared with placebo plus aspirin at a median follow-up of 40 months,
but increased major bleeding, including intracranial haemorrhage.584
A default DAPT duration of 6 months is recommended for CCS pa-
tients undergoing PCI.556 However, multiple RCTs have investigated
shorter DAPT durations (1 or 3 months) to decrease the risk of
bleeding.570,573,585–588 The combined evidence indeed shows a decrease
in—mostly minor—bleeding, without an increase in ischaemic events, in-
dicating that a shorter duration of DAPT of 1–3 months post-PCI may
benefit CCS patients who are not at high ischaemic risk or who are at HBR.
This concept was tested in the MASTER-DAPT trial (Management of
High Bleeding Risk Patients Post Bioresorbable Polymer Coated Stent
Implantation with an Abbreviated versus Standard DAPT Regimen),
randomizing 4579 PCI patients (∼50% CCS) with HBR, after 1-month
uneventful DAPT, to immediate DAPT discontinuation or to DAPT
continuation for at least 2 additional months.587 After 335 days, the trial
demonstrated that discontinuation was non-inferior for ischaemic
events compared with standard duration of DAPT, but major and clin-
ically relevant non-major bleeding was reduced.587
A meta-analysis, including 11 RCTs and 9006 patients (42% CCS) at
HBR [defined by a PREdicting bleeding Complications In patients
undergoing Stent implantation and subsEquent Dual AntiPlatelet
Therapy (PRECISE-DAPT) score of >25 or by Academic Research
Consortium for High Bleeding Risk (ARC-HBR) criteria, listed in
Supplementary data, Table S2]589–591 showed at 12 months of follow-up
that an abbreviated DAPT of 1–3 months reduced both major bleeding
and ischaemic events, as well as cardiovascular mortality, compared with
standard DAPT, irrespective of CCS or ACS presentation.591
The overall data indicate that, in CCS patients with HBR, DAPT dis-
continuation 1–3 months after PCI is recommended, while in patients
without HBR, DAPT duration may be reduced only in the absence of
high ischaemic risk (Figure 11). For patients at high ischaemic risk with-
out HBR, see below.
high ischaemic risk without HBR, there are three options for intensifying
antithrombotic therapy to prevent ischaemic events, albeit at the cost of
increased bleeding: (i) continue DAPT, consisting of aspirin and clopido-
grel or of aspirin and prasugrel after PCI, based on the results of the
DAPT Study;592 (ii) add ticagrelor to aspirin in post-MI patients, based
on the PEGASUS-TIMI (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in
Patients with Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to
Placebo on a Background of Aspirin - Thrombolysis In Myocardial
Infarction) 54 trial;593 or (iii) add very low-dose rivaroxaban to aspirin
in CCS patients, based on the COMPASS trial (Cardiovascular
Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulant Strategies).594
The randomized DAPT Study demonstrated, in patients at 1-year
post-PCI, that an additional 18 months of DAPT reduced ischaemic
events compared with aspirin alone, but moderate and severe GUSTO
(Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator
for Occluded Arteries) or BARC bleeding rates were higher, and all-
cause death tended to be increased.592 Of note, in the DAPT Study, first-
generation DES were used with an increased risk of stent thrombosis.
The PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial showed that in aspirin-treated patients
with a history of MI 1–3 years previously and at least one high-risk char-
acteristic (i.e. aged >65 years, DM, second MI, multivessel CAD, or
CKD), ticagrelor (90 or 60 mg b.i.d.) vs. placebo reduced ischaemic
events at 3 years, while it increased TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial
Infarction) major, but not fatal, bleeding.593 The 60 mg dose was safer
and better tolerated than the 90 mg dose584,593 and therefore approved.
The subgroups of patients with (compared with those without) DM,
multivessel CAD, and PAD benefited more from ticagrelor.595–597
The COMPASS trial demonstrated that the combination of aspirin
plus rivaroxaban 2.5 mg b.i.d., but not rivaroxaban 5.0 mg b.i.d. mono-
therapy, reduced ischaemic events, but increased modified-ISTH
(International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis) major bleeding,
compared with aspirin alone in patients with stable atherosclerotic
disease (mostly CAD, with additional risk conditions if younger than
bleeding between the two treatment arms, and death rates were lower
in the aspirin plus rivaroxaban 2.5 mg b.i.d. group. Subgroups of patients
with (compared with those without) DM, PAD, mild CKD, and active
smoking habit benefited more from aspirin plus rivaroxaban.594,598
Patient eligibility for extended intensified antithrombotic therapy
must be defined taking into account individual patient characteristics
(see Supplementary data, Table S2), as well as study inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria. The different options are described in Table 8.

ing (e.g. complex left main stem, 2-stent bifurcation, suboptimal stenting result, prior stent thrombosis, previously known CYP2C19*2/*3 polymorphisms),

treatment with ticagrelor or prasugrel.601,602 In patients with CCS,
current evidence does not support the routine use of genotype or plate-
let function testing.602–607 However, in patients undergoing high-risk PCI
who are known carriers of a CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele, replacing
aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus ticagrelor or prasugrel is a rea-
sonable option.600,607,608
mized data from patients with recent MI not undergoing PCI, followed
for up to 4 years, showed that OAC monotherapy with a vitamin K
antagonist (VKA) targeted to an international normalized ratio (INR)
of about 3.0–4.0 was at least as effective as low-dose aspirin in prevent-
ing MACE, but with a significant increase in major bleeding.609,610
Moreover, given the obsoletely high INR target and the cumbersome
management, VKA has not gained popularity for secondary prevention
in patients with CCS. Successful introduction of the direct oral
anticoagulants (DOACs) for stroke prevention in AF and for preven-
tion and treatment of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) has renewed
the interest in OAC for patients with CAD. The COMPASS trial in
CCS and/or PAD patients at high ischaemic risk, however, reported
no significant ischaemic benefit of rivaroxaban monotherapy 5 mg twice
daily over aspirin alone, with a significantly higher incidence of
modified-ISTH major bleeding, although not of fatal bleeding.594
Thus, in CCS patients without a concomitant long-term indication
for OAC, OAC monotherapy with either VKA or rivaroxaban (the
only DOAC currently tested in this context) is not recommended.
OAC may be considered, however, when antiplatelet agents are not
tolerated, if the risk of bleeding is not high,594,611 or in CCS patients
with a concomitant long-term indication for OAC (see below).
after percutaneous coronary intervention in chronic coronary
syndrome patients with AF or other indication for oral anticoagu-
lant. Approximately one in five patients with AF need to undergo
PCI, with a theoretical indication for both OAC for stroke prevention
(for which DOACs are preferred to VKA) and DAPT for stent throm-
bosis and MI prevention, leading to triple antithrombotic therapy.612,613
The combination of an OAC plus DAPT, however, leads to an in-
creased bleeding risk, and major bleeding is associated with earlier mor-
tality and should therefore be avoided when possible.614 In this setting,
the results of five RCTs have shown that double compared with triple
antithrombotic therapy reduced major or clinically relevant non-major
bleeding, without a significant increase of ischaemic events, leading to
the recommended use of double antithrombotic therapy (OAC plus
P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, mostly clopidogrel) after a 1–4 week
period of triple antithrombotic therapy in CCS patients with AF under-
going PCI.615–620
The AUGUSTUS trial (Open-Label, 2 × 2 Factorial, Randomized
Controlled, Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety of Apixaban versus
Vitamin K Antagonist and Aspirin versus Aspirin Placebo in Patients
with AF and Acute Coronary Syndrome or Percutaneous Coronary
Intervention) additionally demonstrated that the DOAC apixaban re-
duced major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding compared with
VKA, independently of a double or triple antithrombotic regimen.619
The AUGUSTUS trial and several meta-analyses demonstrated that as-
pirin compared with placebo reduced stent thrombosis events, which
occurred mainly during the first 30 days after PCI and not thereafter,
while increasing bleeding risk.620–622
Thus, based on the combined evidence, double antithrombotic ther-
apy with a DOAC and clopidogrel for up to 12 months should be stand-
ard care for CCS patients with AF undergoing PCI, with additional
aspirin only for a limited initial period (from during PCI up to a max-
imum of 30 days in patients at high ischaemic risk). In patients with
the highest bleeding risk, clopidogrel discontinuation at 6 (or even 3)
months post-PCI and continuation of OAC alone may be considered
when ischaemic risk is not high [Class IIb/level of evidence (LOE) C].
Ticagrelor or prasugrel should generally not be used as part of triple an-
tithrombotic therapy, while ticagrelor, and possibly prasugrel (although
specific data are not available), may be considered as part of double

antithrombotic therapy when there is a very high risk of stent throm-
bosis and a low bleeding risk.619,623,624
After a 6- to 12-month period of double antithrombotic therapy, in
most AF-PCI CCS patients, OAC alone is preferred over continuation
of double antithrombotic therapy.625,626 An open-label randomized trial,
conducted in 2236 Japanese AF patients who had undergone PCI (71% of
patients) or CABG (11% of patients) >1 year before or had known CAD
not requiring revascularization, compared rivaroxaban monotherapy (15
or 10 mg once daily based on creatinine clearance) with rivaroxaban plus
SAPT (mostly aspirin).627 At a median follow-up of 23 months, the occur-
rence of ISTH major bleeding and of all-cause deaths were each signifi-
cantly

occurrence did not differ significantly in the two treatment arms.627
Whether the above considerations remain valid when the indication
for OAC is other than AF, e.g. mechanical heart valves (where
DOACs are not indicated) or VTE, is uncertain given limited available evi-
dence. In the absence of data regarding the efficacy for MACE prevention
of rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily and apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily, which
should be used for extended OAC after the first 6 months of therapeutic
anticoagulation in patients with VTE,628 it is recommended to resume full
doses of these anticoagulants in case of concomitant CCS.
Low-dose aspirin is recommended lifelong in patients undergoing
CABG.629,630 Aspirin should be continued until the day of CABG and
restarted as soon as there is no concern over bleeding, possibly within
stopped at intervals related to their duration of action (prasugrel
stopped ≥7 days before; clopidogrel ≥5 days before; ticagrelor
≥3 days before; and rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran
Although not consistent, there is evidence that DAPT with a P2Y12 re-
ceptor inhibitor compared with aspirin monotherapy provides higher
graft patency rates after CABG.635,636,637 A meta-analysis of four
RCTs, involving 1316 patients (with 3079 grafts) followed for 3 to 12
months after CABG, reported superior vein graft patency with
ticagrelor-based DAPT vs. aspirin alone, but with increased rates of
BARC 2–5 (but not BARC 3–5) bleeds, and no significant differences
in cardiovascular death, or the composite of cardiovascular death,
MI, and stroke, or the composite of all-cause death, MI, stroke, and
revascularization.635 Therefore, in patients undergoing CABG for CCS,
DAPT is not routinely indicated; however, it may be considered in se-
lected cases at increased risk of graft occlusion who are not at high bleed-
ing risk (defined in Supplementary data, Tables S2 and S3).
Transient new-onset AF is common 2 to 3 days after CABG, occur-
ring in approximately one-third of patients.638 AF after CABG is asso-
ciated with a higher stroke risk,639 which is, however, lower than that
with AF unrelated to surgery.640 The impact of early OAC initiation
on patient outcomes remains unclear.641,642 In a Danish cohort study,
early OAC initiation was associated with a lower risk of thrombo-
embolic events,641 while in a Swedish cohort study, OAC was asso-
ciated with no reduction of thrombo-embolic complications but an
increased risk of major bleeding.642
Decisions on OAC should consider thrombo-embolic and bleeding
risks, timing, and duration of post-operative AF. Longer AF durations
and delayed-onset post-CABG have higher risks. We refer to the
dations for OAC in this context. It is unknown whether, in such pa-
tients, the combination of aspirin and OAC may be more effective
compared with OAC alone in preventing ischaemic events post-CABG.
Antithrombotic therapy may provoke GI bleeding, especially in patients at
increased risk, such as the elderly, those with a history of GI bleeding or
peptic disease, high alcohol consumption, chronic use of steroids or non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or receiving a combination of
antithrombotic drugs.643–645 In patients on various types of antithrombo-
tic therapy, proton pump inhibitors may be effective in reducing the risk of
GI bleeding, in particular from gastroduodenal lesions.646–648 In general,
gastric protection with proton pump inhibitors is recommended in pa-
tients at increased risk of GI bleeding for as long as any antithrombotic
therapy is administered.65,86 Because the proton pump inhibitors omepra-
zole and esomeprazole inhibit CYP2C19, when administered with clopi-
dogrel, they reduce exposure to clopidogrel’s active metabolite; while
their use is discouraged in combination with clopidogrel, univocal effects
of these combinations on the risk of ischaemic events or stent thrombosis
have not been demonstrated (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/
human/EPAR/plavix).643,646 Of note, proton pump inhibitors do not in-
crease MACE vs. placebo in patients with CVD.646

cEnhanced thrombotic/ischaemic risk criteria for extended treatment with a second antithrombotic agent (Supplementary data, Table S3). Thrombotic risk encompasses (i) the risk of
thrombosis occurring, and (ii) the risk of death should a thrombotic event occur, both of which relate to anatomical, procedural, and clinical characteristics. Thrombotic/ischaemic risk
factors for CCS (that may also apply to CABG) patients include stenting of left main stem, proximal LAD, or last remaining patent artery; suboptimal stent deployment; stent length of
>60 mm; diabetes mellitus; CKD; bifurcation with two stents implanted; treatment of chronic total occlusion; and previous stent thrombosis on adequate antithrombotic therapy.

Evidence from genetic, epidemiological, and randomized clinical
studies has established the key causal role of LDL-C and other
apo-B-containing lipoproteins in the development of atherosclerotic
disease.669 In patients with established ASCVD, lowering of LDL-C le-
vels reduces the risk of recurrent MACE.128,670,671 Elevated lipid levels
should be managed according to the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the
diovascular disease prevention in clinical practice.16
Because patients with CCS are considered at very high cardiovascular
risk, the treatment goal is to lower LDL-C levels to <1.4 mmol/L
(<55 mg/dL) and achieve a reduction by at least 50% from baseline.
For patients who experience a second vascular event within 2 years
while taking maximum tolerated statin-based therapy, an even lower
LDL-C goal of <1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) may be considered.
In addition to exercise, diet, and weight control, which favourably af-
fect blood lipid levels and are recommended for all patients with CCS
(see Section 5.1), pharmacological treatment with a maximally tolerated
dose of a potent statin is the first-line therapy recommended for all
CCS patients.128,670,671 In a landmark meta-analysis involving patients
with and without ASCVD, statin treatment was shown to reduce the
risk of major vascular events by 22%, all-cause mortality by 10%, and
mortality due to coronary heart disease by 20% per 1.0 mmol/L of
achieved reduction in LDL-C levels.670 High-intensity statin treatment
(i.e. atorvastatin ≥40 mg or rosuvastatin ≥20 mg daily) reduces
LDL-C levels by 45%–50% on average, although interindividual variabil-
ity exists.672 Statins should not be given when pregnancy is planned,
during pregnancy, or during the breastfeeding period.64
In many patients with CCS, statin therapy alone will not suffice to
achieve the recommended LDL-C goals;673 hence, a combination of
lipid-lowering drug therapy is required. In a trial of patients with recent
ACS, the combination of statin with ezetimibe resulted in additional re-
duction of LDL-C levels by 20%–25% compared with simvastatin
monotherapy. This LDL-C reduction translated into a modest reduc-
tion of a composite endpoint involving fatal and non-fatal events
(6.4% RR reduction, 2.0% absolute risk reduction).674 Ezetimibe should
be used as second-line therapy when the treatment goal is not achieved
with maximally tolerated statin therapy, or as first-line therapy in the
case of intolerance to any statin regimen. Proprotein convertase subti-
lisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (alirocumab or evolocumab), administered
subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks, lower LDL-C levels by 60% when
added to statin therapy.675 In cardiovascular outcomes trials, these
monoclonal antibodies resulted in significant reduction of non-fatal car-
diovascular events, with no impact on cardiovascular mortality.675,676
Their favourable safety profile was recently confirmed for longer
follow-up (median 5 years) in open-label extension studies of the out-
comes trials.677 The high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors is still a limitation for
broader implementation.
Bempedoic acid is an oral cholesterol synthesis inhibitor that lowers
LDL-C by approximately 18% in monotherapy and 38% when com-
bined with ezetimibe.678,679 In a recent cardiovascular outcomes trial
including statin-intolerant patients, bempedoic acid significantly re-
duced MACE.680 Inclisiran, a small interfering ribonucleic acid molecule,
is administered subcutaneously every 3–6 months and reduces LDL-C
by approximately 50% either in combination with statin or without sta-
tin therapy.681 A cardiovascular outcomes trials for inclisiran is current-
ly underway (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03705234).
In patients scheduled to undergo elective PCI, pre-treatment with a
high-dose statin in statin-naïve patients or loading with high-dose statin
in statin-treated patients has been shown to reduce the risk of
periprocedural events.682 Routine pre-treatment or loading (in the
context of pre-existing statin treatment) with a high-dose statin can
be considered in patients with CCS undergoing PCI.
angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor
Modulation of the RAAS and the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril in com-
bination with a RAS blocker has proved beneficial in patients with HF
post-MI and in patients with hypertension. In these clinical syndromes,
RAAS inhibition has greatly improved morbidity and mortality.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) can reduce mortal-
ity, MI, stroke, and HF among patients with LV dysfunction,683–685 pre-
vious vascular disease,686–688 and high-risk DM.689 These data bring
strong evidence to recommend ACE-Is [or angiotensin receptor block-
ers (ARBs) in cases of intolerance] for the treatment of patients with
CCS with co-existing hypertension, LVEF ≤40%, DM, or CKD, unless
contraindicated (e.g. severe renal impairment, hyperkalaemia, etc.). In
trials that include patients with mildly reduced and preserved LV func-
tion >40%, the effect of ACE-Is to reduce all-cause death, cardiovascu-
lar death, non-fatal MI, stroke, or HF in patients with atherosclerosis is
not uniform.686,687,690 A meta-analysis, including 24 trials and 61 961
patients, documented that, in CCS patients without HF, RAAS inhibi-
tors reduced cardiovascular events and death only when compared

with placebo, but not when compared with active control treat-
ment.691 For this reason ACE-I therapy in CCS patients without HF
or high cardiovascular risk is not generally recommended, unless re-
quired to meet BP targets. However, a new observational study
showed that ACE-I/ARB therapy was associated with significant long-
term survival benefit in patients post-PCI for STEMI/non-ST-segment
elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This survival benefit is appar-
ent in patients with both preserved and reduced LV function. These
findings provide contemporary evidence to support the use of these
agents in coronary patients who underwent PCI for STEMI/NSTEMI, ir-
respective of their baseline LV function.692
Sacubitril/valsartan contains an ARB and a prodrug of neprilysin
inhibitor, which inhibits the degradation of endogenous natriuretic pep-
tides. In patients with LVEF ≤35% (of ischaemic aetiology in 60%),
sacubitril/valsartan proved to reduce HF hospitalization and cardiovas-
cular death compared with ACE-I.693 Moreover, sacubitril/valsartan
may decrease myocardial ischaemia because of its effect in reducing
LV wall stress and improving coronary circulation. The risk of coronary
events using sacubitril/valsartan compared with ACE-I was also signifi-
cantly reduced on post-hoc analyses.694
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists
Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and GLP-1 recep-
tor agonists were initially intended as glucose-lowering medications for
patients with type 2 DM; however, a growing body of evidence has es-
tablished that these drugs lower ASCVD risk and confer cardiovascular
benefits beyond their glucose-lowering potential.688,695–697 Among pa-
tients with DM, SGLT2 inhibitor use was associated with a reduced risk
of MACE, especially in patients with established ASCVD.698 The exact
mechanism(s) by which SGLT2 inhibitors improve CVD outcomes re-
main largely unknown, but several hypotheses have been pro-
posed.695,696,699–702 The benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors may relate
more to cardiorenal haemodynamic effects than to atherosclerosis16
The cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonists is driven by re-
duced risk of ASCVD-related events.703 Overall, the results of cardio-
vascular outcome trials of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor
agonists support their recommendation as first-line treatment for all
patients with type 2 DM and ASCVD including CCS, independently
of decisions about glycaemic management (Recommendation Table 19).
In patients with HF with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved EF (HFpEF),
dapagliflozin and empagliflozin lowered the risk of worsening HF or car-
diovascular death in the presence or absence of type 2 DM.704–707
Recent results indicate benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on hospitalization
for HF and cardiovascular death in patients at high cardiovascular risk, ir-
respective of HF history.708 Recommendations for the use of SGLT2 in-
hibitors in patients with diabetes and patients with HF are detailed in the
treatment of acute and chronic heart failure526 and its 2023 Focused
Update. 709 Recommendations on the use of these medications in pa-
tients with HF are given in Section 4.3.4 and Recommendation Table 24.
In patients with pre-existing CVD, the SELECT trial assessed the ef-
fect of weekly subcutaneous administration of the GLP-1 receptor
agonist semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg on MACE reduction in over-
weight or obese adults without type 2 DM. The trial involved 17 604
patients with established CVD and a BMI ≥27 kg/m2. Patients lost a
mean of 9.4% of body weight over the first 2 years with semaglutide
vs. 0.88% with placebo. The primary cardiovascular endpoint—a
composite of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal MI, or non-
fatal stroke—was reduced significantly, with an HR of 0.80 (95% CI,
Four large double-blind trials have compared the effects of anti-
inflammatory agents vs. placebo in patients with atherothrombotic

monoclonal antibody canakinumab against placebo in over 10 000 pa-
tients with previous MI and plasma C-reactive protein ≥2 mg/L.712

Revascularization by both modalities improves angina-related health

survival benefit above medical therapy for CABG in patients with left
main disease,718–721 as well as three-vessel disease,722 particularly in pa-
tients with LV dysfunction.719,723,724 Most of this evidence was obtained
prior to the introduction of disease-modifying therapies such as ACE-Is/
ARBs and statins. Meta-analytical evidence suggests a potential benefit
of PCI on cardiovascular survival,55,725,726 which, similarly to CABG, ap-
pears to be related to the prevention of MI.55,727 In general, among sur-
gically eligible patients with multivessel disease, CABG is superior to
PCI and to medical therapy, particularly in those with diabetes and high-
er coronary complexity.727,728 Recent evidence has generated contro-
versy on (i) the value of routine early revascularization compared with
optimal medical therapy alone,47,56,314,729 (ii) the value of PCI vs. CABG
for complex CAD,326,730 and (iii) the value of ischaemia testing for
decision-making in revascularization.315,317,726 At the same time, ad-
vances in interventional technologies and medications have expanded
the application of PCI to more complex forms of CAD.731
revascularization
In CAD patients with moderate or severe inducible ischaemia but no
left main disease nor LVEF of <35%, the largest-to-date ISCHEMIA trial,
up to 5 years, did not show significant benefit of an initial invasive strat-
egy over an initial conservative strategy for the primary endpoint of is-
chaemic cardiovascular events or death from any cause,47 triggering
discussion about the role of initial angiography followed by revascular-
ization when feasible, in this type of CCS patients, once optimal medical
therapy has been established. The CLARIFY registry found that many
CCS patients with angina experience a resolution of symptoms over
time, often without changes in treatment or revascularization, and ex-
perience good outcomes.404 While these findings suggest that this type
of CCS patients should initially receive conservative medical manage-
ment, it is worth noting that patients who were randomly assigned
to the invasive strategy in the ISCHEMIA trial experienced significantly
lower rates of spontaneous MI and greater improvement in
angina-related health status compared with those assigned to the con-
servative strategy.47,50 Furthermore, the ORBITA 2 trial demonstrated
that patients with stable angina, who were receiving minimal or no anti-
anginal medication and had objective evidence of ischaemia, experi-
enced a lower angina symptom score following PCI treatment
compared with a placebo procedure, indicating a better health status
with respect to angina.52 Although initial conservative medical manage-
ment of CCS patients is generally preferred, symptom improvement by
revascularization should therefore not be neglected if patients remain
symptomatic despite antianginal treatment.
After publication of the ISCHEMIA trial results, several meta-
analyses have reported similar overall survival and inevitably higher
rates of procedural MI with routine revascularization, while confirming
consistently greater freedom from spontaneous MI, unstable angina,
and anginal symptoms after revascularization compared with GDMT
alone.732–734 Of note, these meta-analyses showed some differences

Furthermore, the importance of ‘any myocardial infarction’ as an end-
point is complicated by a debate over the prognostic importance of
procedural infarctions as well as how various MI definitions affect the
prediction of long-term outcomes735,736 A more recent meta-analysis
of RCTs that included the longest available follow-up showed that add-
ing revascularization to GDMT reduced cardiac mortality compared
with GDMT alone. The cardiac survival benefit improved with the dur-
ation of follow-up and was linearly related to a lower rate of spontan-
eous MI.55
In ISCHEMIA, patients randomized to initial medical therapy alone had
significantly more spontaneous MIs during the 5-year follow-up, which
were associated with subsequent cardiovascular death.737 An early inva-
sive strategy was associated with lower long-term risks of cardiovascular
events, mainly spontaneous MIs, compared with a conservative strategy,
at the cost of a higher risk of procedural MIs.738
Extended follow-up of the ISCHEMIA trial population up to 7 years
(ISCHEMIA-EXTEND) revealed a significant 2.2% absolute decrease in
cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63–0.96) favour-
ing the initial invasive strategy.56 The benefit was most marked in pa-
tients with multivessel CAD (≥70% diameter stenosis on CCTA;
adjusted HR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48–0.97) but was offset by a significant
difference (absolute decrease of −0.7%) in all-cause mortality.56 In a re-
cent meta-analysis of 18 trials, on the other hand, non-cardiac mortality
did not differ significantly by initial invasive or conservative strategy in
CCS patients with preserved or slightly impaired LVEF.739 In a post
hoc analysis of the ISCHEMIA trial, CAD severity was associated with
a higher risk of all-cause death, MI, and the primary endpoint of the
trial.317 This effect appeared to be most noticeable in patients with mul-
tivessel disease and/or proximal LAD stenosis (≥70% diameter stenosis
on CCTA).
left ventricular function: myocardial viability,
revascularization, and its modality
Ischaemic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of HFrEF, and new ischae-
mic events are the main drivers of worsening LV function, strongly im-
pacting long-term survival.740 Ischaemic HFrEF is characterized by
irreversibly damaged and scarred myocardium alternating with ‘viable’
myocardium that may be dysfunctional owing to repetitive ischaemic epi-
sodes (stunning) or chronic hypoperfusion (hibernation).741 According
to classical concepts, revascularization combined with GDMT synergis-
tically improves systolic LV function and overall prognosis in patients
with ischaemic HFrEF by restoring sufficient perfusion to dysfunctional
yet viable myocardial segments and preventing new ischaemic events.742
However, it carries increased periprocedural risk, especially in patients
with severe LV dysfunction (LVEF ≤35%). A meta-analysis of 26 obser-
vational studies, including 4119 patients, showed that CABG can be per-
formed with acceptable operative mortality (5.4%; 95% CI, 4.5%–6.4%)
and 5-year actuarial survival (75%) in patients with severe LV dysfunction
(mean pre-operative EF of 24.7%).743
In the 1990s, observational studies reported improved survival after
revascularization in patients with severe CAD, significant LV dysfunc-
tion, and evidence of myocardial viability on imaging tests.744 The
PARR-2 trial (PET and Recovery Following Revascularization) rando-
mized 430 patients with suspected ischaemic cardiomyopathy to an
F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET-assisted strategy or standard care.
While there was a non-significant trend towards lower risk of cardiac
events at 1 year with PET assistance,745 the 5-year follow-up showed
no overall reduction in cardiac events.746 However, significant benefits
were observed when adhering to PET recommendations (after exclud-
ing 25% protocol violations).746 Post hoc analyses and substudies con-
firmed the positive outcomes of a PET-guided strategy.747,748
The Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) trial ran-
domized 1212 patients with CAD without left main diseases eligible
for CABG and LVEF ≤35% to receive either CABG and GDMT, or
GDMT alone. The trial failed to achieve its primary endpoint of all-cause
mortality at a median follow-up of 4 years (HR with CABG, 0.86; 95% CI,
all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were significantly reduced with
CABG compared with GDMT alone (from 66.1% to 58.9%; HR 0.84;
CI, 0.66–0.93; P = .006, respectively).54 The reduction of cardiovascular
mortality by CABG was greater in patients with three-vessel disease54
and the reduction of all-cause mortality was greater in younger patients,
in whom cardiovascular deaths accounted for a larger proportion of
deaths vs. older patients (P = .004 for interaction).749 Viability was as-
sessed by SPECT, dobutamine echocardiography, or both in 50% of
STICH patients (298 randomized to CABG and 303 randomized to
GDMT alone).750 There were no significant interactions between pres-
ence or absence of myocardial viability and improved LV function or
long-term survival benefit for CABG above GDMT.747,748,750
There have been no RCTs directly comparing CABG and PCI in pa-
tients with ischaemic HF. A meta-analysis of 21 studies, mostly obser-
vational except three including STICH, published between 1983 and
priate patients with multivessel disease and LV systolic dysfunction; re-
vascularization with either CABG or PCI improved long-term survival
compared with GDMT, but compared with PCI, CABG provided a sur-
vival benefit and a lower risk of MI or repeat revascularization, with a
slightly higher incidence of stroke.751
PCI is increasingly used over CABG for treating patients with ischaemic
HF and multivessel disease, as shown by two large registries.752,753 While
these registries suggest that CABG is associated with a lower risk of long-
term all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and lower MACE compared
with PCI in patients with CAD and LVEF ≤35%,752,753 it is important to
interpret these observational studies with great caution, given significant
differencesinbaselinecharacteristics,includingage, historyofpreviousMI,
severity of CAD, and completeness of revascularization.754 For the com-
parison of CABG with PCI in managing ischaemic HF with severely im-
paired LV dysfunction and multivessel CAD, the results of ongoing trials
(NCT05427370 and NCT05329285) are awaited.
The Percutaneous Revascularization for Ischemic Left Ventricular
Dysfunction (REVIVED-BCIS2) trial randomized 700 patients with im-
paired LV function (EF ≤35%), extensive CAD amenable to PCI, and
evidence of myocardial viability in at least four dysfunctional myocardial
segments to a strategy of PCI plus GDMT or GDMT alone.729 After a
ite primary endpoint of all-cause death or HF rehospitalization (HR
and temporary improvements in their symptoms and no incremental
improvement of overall LV function compared with GDMT.
A pre-specified secondary analysis of REVIVED-BCIS2, conducted in
bility extent (assessed by CMR or dobutamine stress echocardiog-
raphy) and outcomes, thereby challenging the traditional concept of
myocardial hibernation, which can be reversed by revascularization.755
However, the analysis did find that larger amounts of non-viable myo-
cardium were linked to an increased risk of the primary outcome,
regardless of whether PCI was performed, suggesting that viability as-
sessment may be useful for risk stratification.
The two main RCTs, STICH and REVIVED-BCIS2, differ in various
aspects. The REVIVED-BCIS2 trial patients were, on average, 10 years
older than those in the STICH trial, had a less frequent history of MI
(50% vs. 78%) and were more likely to be angina-free at baseline
(67% vs. 36%). REVIVED-BCIS2 included fewer patients with three-
vessel disease (38% vs. 60%). Additionally, patients in REVIVED-
BCIS2 received more modern HF therapy and were more commonly
treated
with
an
ICD/CRT
(cardiac
resynchronization
therapy)
(21%/53% vs. 2%/19%). Finally, the duration of follow-up was shorter
compared with the STICH trials. All these factors may have contributed
to the absence of any PCI effect on survival.
In conclusion, the heterogeneous designs of the above studies, the
statistical underpower of subgroup analyses, the heterogeneous meth-
ods of viability assessments (e.g. based on metabolism, contractile re-
serve, or scar extent) and variable quantification (dichotomous vs.
continuous) leave many open questions on how viability should be de-
fined,756 and when and why it should be assessed in ischaemic HFrEF
patients. For instance, the classical binary definition of myocardial viabil-
ity may benefit from more contemporary paradigms and from greater
focus on anatomic alignment between viable myocardial regions and
feasible revascularization of corresponding perfusing arteries.741
Moreover, therapeutic aims should go beyond enhancing local and
overall LV function to include safeguarding against new ischaemic
events727 and their ensuing possibly lethal arrhythmias. Therefore, an
integrative approach, including highly specialized imaging, HF, arrhyth-
mia, and revascularization specialists, is needed for optimal patient man-
agement and improved outcomes.
revascularization
Complete revascularization treating all vessels and lesions causing is-
chaemia is preferable to incomplete revascularization.757 However,
various factors may influence the implementation of complete revascu-
larization, including clinical setting, comorbidities, anatomical and pro-
cedural
features,
advanced
age,
or
frailty.758,759
Furthermore,
whether the focus of complete revascularization should be anatomical
or functional is still unclear. In the PCI group of the SYNTAX (SYNergy
Between PCI with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery) trial, a higher residual
SYNTAX score, indicating incomplete anatomical revascularization,
was associated with a higher mortality rate.760 However, the outcomes
of anatomically incomplete but functionally complete revascularization
by PCI were superior to those of anatomically complete revasculariza-
tion.49,308,761 Of note, recent studies suggest that significant levels of re-
sidual ischaemia can persist despite good angiographic results after
complex coronary stenting.
Individual reports suggest that incomplete revascularization is asso-
ciated with increased mortality compared with complete revasculariza-
tion.762 In addition, unintended incomplete revascularization appears to
be a surrogate marker of anatomic complexity and comorbidities, pre-
disposing to more rapid native CAD progression.760,763 An important
predictor of anatomical incomplete revascularization by PCI is the pres-
ence of chronic total occlusion. Randomized trials have shown im-
provements of angina and QoL with PCI for chronic total occlusion
lesions,764,765 but failed to show any reduction of mortality risk and
MI rates.764–767
Among patients with high-risk multivessel CAD, incomplete anatom-
ical revascularization is reported more frequently among those treated
with PCI compared with those treated with CABG. The rate ranges
from 32% to 56% for PCI and 30% to 37% for CABG.759,762,768
However, interpreting these data is challenging due to several factors.
Firstly, there is no uniform definition of complete revascularization.769,770
Secondly, although completeness of revascularization with PCI can be
evaluated immediately after the procedure, many patients require staged
procedures to achieve complete revascularization. Thirdly, within the
first year after CABG, 20% to 40% of patients may experience asymp-
tomatic graft failure as determined by CCTA.771–773 Therefore, selecting
a revascularization modality cannot be based solely on completeness of
revascularization but rather should be determined through shared
decision-making and a risk–benefit assessment.
complexity
While both CABG and PCI have shown continuous technical improve-
ments and better clinical outcomes over time,774,775 the potential benefit
of revascularization must be carefully evaluated against the procedural
risk. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality
(STS-PROM) risk model has proved to be more effective than the
EuroSCORE II risk model in predicting peri-operative mortality and com-
plications in CABG patients due to its continuous calibration.776 It has
also shown satisfactory discrimination for all-cause death at 30 days in pa-
tients undergoing CABG, allowing differentiation of high (>8%) and inter-
mediate (4% to 8%) from low (<4%) surgical mortality risk. Although
primarily designed for surgical risk assessment, the STS-PROM score
can also be used to evaluate the risk of revascularization through PCI
in patients with multivessel disease, as recent studies326 have shown simi-
lar mortality rates between PCI and CABG. However, in patients with
left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) participating in the EXCEL
trial (Evaluation of XIENCE versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery
for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization), the STS risk models
were effective in predicting outcomes for CABG but not for PCI regard-
ing peri-operative mortality and renal failure.777 Interestingly, the STS
stroke risk model was more successful in predicting outcomes for PCI
compared with CABG. More accurate risk prediction tools are needed
to precisely estimate adverse events following LMCAD revascularization
through both CABG and PCI. Other clinical factors, such as frailty or liver
cirrhosis,778,779 have been found to increase post-operative mortality and
should be taken into consideration during the decision-making
process.780
The SYNTAX score was prospectively developed as an angiographic
stratification tool to quantify the complexity of coronary lesions in pa-
tients with left main coronary artery (LMCA) or multivessel CAD and
aid clinicians in deciding the most appropriate revascularization proced-
ure during Heart Team discussions.781 However, there are limitations
to the SYNTAX score. Firstly, it is a time-consuming score requiring
a detailed angiographic evaluation of each lesion. Secondly, there is con-
siderable inter-observer variability in its calculation, with a poor correl-
ation between core lab and operator-calculated SYNTAX score being
reported.779 Thirdly, it is an anatomical score that quantifies obstruc-
tion but not plaque burden. Fourthly, it does not take physiological
and clinical variables into account.782 Machine learning may streamline
this process, generating prognostic information that is superior to clin-
ical risk scores783 and relevant to clinical decision-making.
The SYNTAX II score was developed by combining clinical and ana-
tomic features to better guide decision-making between CABG and PCI
than the anatomical SYNTAX score.784,785 Although the usefulness of
the SYNTAX II score was demonstrated in several studies,785–787 it
overestimated 4-year all-cause mortality in the EXCEL trial.788 The up-
dated version, SYNTAX score II 2020, using the SYNTAX Extended
Survival (SYNTAXES) data and external validation in the population
of the FREEDOM, BEST, and PRECOMBAT trials,789 showed modest
CABG of 0.62 and 0.67, respectively) and acceptable discrimination
for predicting 10-year mortality. Another validation study indicated
that the score displayed acceptable discrimination for all-cause mortal-
ity at 5 years in a Japanese cohort with LMCAD and/or multivessel
CAD,787 but external validation in a prospective setting is lacking.783
The British Cardiovascular Intervention Society myocardial jeopardy
score (BCIS-JS) is an alternative to the SYNTAX score, enabling the as-
sessment of the severity and extent of CAD. It has been proven effect-
ive in predicting mortality after PCI and assessing the completeness of
revascularization,790 but it is not as commonly used as the SYNTAX
score.
modality
Both myocardial revascularization modalities—PCI and CABG—can
achieve excellent outcomes, although through different mechanisms,
in appropriately selected patients when GDMT alone fails.
Randomized evidence and subgroup analyses of trials enrolling a broad-
er spectrum of CAD patients showed similar performance of PCI and
CABG in patients with one- or two-vessel CAD, with or without the
involvement of the proximal LAD in terms of death, stroke, or
MI.791–797 In patients with complex LAD lesions, the need for late re-
peat revascularization is higher after PCI than CABG,797 but CABG is
a more invasive procedure with inherent risks, longer hospital stay
and healing.758
Over the past two decades, several trials have compared PCI and
CABG in patients with multivessel CAD, with or without unprotected
LMCAD326,728,730,798–801 (Table 9). The patients who were included in
these trials had to meet the eligibility criteria for both CABG or PCI at
an acceptable risk level, and their coronary anatomy had to allow com-
plete revascularization through both procedures. However, due to the
strict inclusion criteria, only a small percentage of eligible patients (ran-
ging from 6% to 40%) were enrolled in these trials.798,801 The strict in-
clusion criteria resulted in enrolling a relatively young population with a
lower burden of comorbidities (mean age <66 years).728,730,798,801
Meta-analyses of RCTs have shown that the risk of death is similar for
both CABG and PCI for LMCAD, even for patients with a high
SYNTAX score, up to 5–10 years after the intervention. However,
the risk of stroke is higher with CABG, while the risk of spontaneous
MI is higher with PCI.728,730,800,802–804 In the individual-patient data
meta-analysis of four randomized trials,730 mortality over 5 years was
not statistically different between patients treated with PCI or with
CABG [11.2% vs. 10.2%; HR 1.10 (95% CI, 0.91–1.32); P = .33; absolute
risk difference of 0.9%]. A similar treatment effect was observed for
P = .25; absolute risk difference 2.0%]. Spontaneous MI was lower in
the CABG arm [6.2% vs. 2.6%; HR 2.35 (95% CI, 1.71–3.23);
P < .0001; absolute risk difference 3.5%], while the results of periproce-
dural MI differed according to whether the analysis used the protocol
definition or the universal definition of MI (available for only two
studies). Stroke was not statistically different overall [2.7% vs. 3.1%;
HR 0.84 (95% CI, 0.59–1.21); P = .36; absolute risk difference of
−0.4%]. However, in a pre-specified analysis of the first 12 months of
follow-up, stroke was lower after PCI than after CABG [0.6% vs.
of −1.0%].782 Subgroup analysis based on the SYNTAX score and
the number of additionally involved coronary vessels revealed no differ-
ence in all-cause mortality between CABG and PCI for SYNTAX score
≤32 or LMCA stenosis with 0/1 vessel disease. However, a trend for
higher all-cause mortality was noted with PCI for SYNTAX score
>32 (HR 1.30; 95% CI, 0.92–1.84) and/or LMCA stenosis with 2/3 ves-
sel disease (HR 1.25; 95% CI, 0.97–1.60).782 Of note, the LMCA sten-
osis involved distal bifurcation in 75% of the patients, and the absence of
a bifurcation lesion had no impact on mortality.730 True bifurcation left
main lesions (defined as Medina type 1,1,1 or 0,1,1 both main vessel and
side vessel >50% narrowed with reference diameters ≥2.75 mm),805
which frequently require 2-stent techniques, have worse clinical out-
comes than non-bifurcation lesions.806–808 Despite excellent results
after LMCA bifurcation stenting on angiography, 13% of patients still
experience residual ischaemia in turn associated with higher long-
term cardiovascular mortality.809 Using intracoronary imaging guidance
to optimize stent expansion and prevent side-branch jailing may im-
prove outcomes after PCI of bifurcation LMCA lesions.810
Operator experience may significantly affect the outcomes after
interventional procedures. A single-centre study from China found
that operators with a higher volume of procedures performed
(>15 per year) had better outcomes for unprotected LMCA PCI.811
An analysis of the outcome data from the British Cardiovascular
Intervention Society’s national PCI database on 6724 patients who under-
went PCI for unprotected LMCA between 2012 and 2014 revealed that
the volume of procedures performed by the operator plays a significant
role in determining the outcome after PCI of unprotected LMCA.812
Although high-volume operators undertook PCIs on patients with greater
comorbid burden and CAD complexity compared with low-volume op-
erators, 12-month survival was lower in high-volume operators [odds
ratio (OR) 0.54; 95% CI, 0.39–0.73]. A close association between oper-
ator volume and superior 12-month survival was observed (P < .001).
A 2022 Joint ESC/EACTS (European Association for Cardio-
Thoracic Surgery) task force recently reviewed the 2018 guideline
recommendations on the revascularization of LMCAD in low-risk
surgical patients with suitable anatomy for PCI or CABG.782 The
review was mainly based on the recent individual-patient data
meta-analysis730 of the long-term outcomes after CABG or PCI for
LMCAD from four randomized clinical trials that included 4394 pa-
tients between March 2005 and January 2015. The review confirmed
that for stable CCS patients with left main stem disease requiring re-
vascularization, both treatment options are clinically reasonable based
on patient preference, expertise availability, and local operator vo-
lumes. It was proposed that revascularization with CABG be the re-
commended option, with suggested class I and LOE A, while PCI be
overall recommended with a suggested class IIa and LOE A. The pre-
sent guidelines confirm that, among patients suitable for both revascu-
larization modalities, CABG is recommended as the overall preferred
revascularization mode over PCI, given the lower risk of spontaneous
MI and repeat revascularization.730,782 The present guidelines also ac-
knowledge that in patients with significant LMCA stenosis of low com-
plexity (SYNTAX score ≤22), in whom PCI can provide equivalent
completeness of revascularization to that of CABG, PCI is recom-
mended as an alternative to CABG, given its lower invasiveness and
non-inferior survival.718,728,730,802,813

The SYNTAX and SYNTAXES randomized trials, comparing PCI and
CABG for multivessel CAD with or without unprotected LMCAD, re-
ported differences in terms of survival and freedom from cardiovascular
events dependent on SYNTAX score.795,798,823 The recently published
ported similar all-cause death rates with both revascularization modal-
ities,795 while there was significantly higher mortality in patients with
SYNTAX scores ≥33 who were randomized for PCI (HR 1.41; 95%
CI, 1.05–1.89).795 A significant 5-year mortality gap between PCI and
CABG has been reported among patients with complex multivessel
CAD in the presence of DM (15.7% after PCI vs. 10.7% after CABG;
HR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.20–1.77; P = .0001).728
In the FREEDOM trial (Strategies for Multivessel Revascularization in
Patients with Diabetes), 1900 patients with diabetes and multivessel
disease without LMCAD were randomized to CABG vs. PCI (using
first-generation DES). Long-term results at a median follow-up dur-
ation of 3.8 years [interquartile range (IQR) 2.5–4.9 years] showed
higher all-cause mortality in the PCI group vs. CABG group (24.3%
vs. 18.3%; P = .01).801 Out of all the centres that participated in the
study, only 25 agreed to participate in the FREEDOM extended follow-
up, and therefore, only 49.6% of patients in the study were followed up
for up to 8 years thus limiting statistical power. The all-cause mortality
rate among the FREEDOM follow-up patients was not significantly dif-
ferent between those who underwent PCI and CABG procedures
(23.7% vs. 18.7%; HR 1.32; 95% CI, 0.97–1.79; P = .076). In multivariable
analysis, a significant interaction emerged between patient age and long-
term survival benefit of CABG surgery. Patients younger than the
median age at study entry (63.3 years) preferentially derived benefit
from CABG; mortality among patients ≤63.3 years old was 20.7%
(PCI) vs. 10.2% (CABG); mortality among patients >63.3 years old
was 26.3% vs. 27.6% (P = .01 for interaction).824
artery disease patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention
Consistently higher rates of repeat revascularizations following PCI
compared with CABG have been shown in clinical trials involving multi-
vessel CAD patients, with significant impacts on outcomes.825 With the
use of modern DESs, the rate of repeat revascularization after PCI has
declined.725,795,802,820 FFR guidance during PCI leads to lower revascu-
larization rates compared with angiography-guided PCI, with fewer
stents placed in the FFR group.826
In the FAME 3 trial, 1500 patients with three-vessel CAD not involv-
ing the LMCA were randomly assigned to PCI with second-generation
DESs (durable polymer zotarolimus-eluting stents) guided by FFR, or to
CABG.326 At 1-year follow-up, the incidence of the composite primary
endpoint, MACCE [major adverse cardiac (death from any cause, MI,
stroke, or repeat revascularization) or cerebrovascular events], was
patients assigned to CABG surgery (HR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.2), findings
that were not consistent with non-inferiority (P = .35 for non-
inferiority).326 At 3-year follow-up, there still was a significantly higher
rate of MACCE for PCI than for CABG (18.6% vs. 12.5%; HR 1.5; 95%
CI, 1.2–2.0; P = .002), consistent with the 1-year follow-up results.
However, there was no difference in the incidence of the composite
of death, MI, or stroke after FFR-guided PCI compared with CABG
(12.0% vs. 9.2%; HR 1.3; 95% CI, 0.98–1.83; P = .07). The rates of death
(4.1% vs. 3.9%; HR 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6–1.7; P = .88) and stroke (1.6% vs.
again occurred more frequently after PCI (7.0% vs. 4.2%; HR 1.7;
frequent after PCI (11.1% vs. 5.9%; HR 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3–2.7;
P = .001). Of note, after both PCI and CABG, event rates were lower
(about half for mortality) than in the SYNTAX cohort of patients with
three-vessel CAD. There was a narrower difference for MI rates be-
tween the two modalities, probably owing to procedural advances
with PCI and CABG and improvements in GDMT. In patients with
less complex CAD (SYNTAX score ≤22), outcomes were as favour-
able as after CABG.
coronary pressure mapping with coronary anatomy for percutaneous
coronary intervention planning
There is increasing evidence on the impact of post-PCI FFR/iFR/QFR on
outcomes after PCI.828–833 A quarter of these patients have residual is-
chaemia (FFR < 0.80 or iFR ≤0.89) after angiographically successful
PCI, with circa 80% of cases attributable to focal lesions not identified
by angiography alone.830 One randomized trial reported that post-PCI
iFR/FFR can be improved by additional intracoronary intervention, in-
cluding post-dilatation or additional stent implantation, but remains
≤0.80 in 18% of cases.829 Preliminary results demonstrate that the
combination of invasive coronary pressure mapping by iFR pullback
or QFR mapping superimposed on the anatomical information of
ICA accurately predict the post-PCI coronary pressure for any combin-
ation of stent location and stent length, as part of a ‘virtual PCI’ ap-
proach,348,834 and allows modification of the procedural planning in
about 30% of cases.835 The AQVA (Angio-based Quantitative Flow
Ratio Virtual PCI Versus Conventional Angio-guided PCI in the
Achievement of an Optimal Post-PCI QFR) trial (n = 300) demonstrated
that a strategy of QFR/ICA-based virtual PCI was associated with a higher
rate of post-PCI QFR ≥0.90 compared with angiography-based PCI
(93.4% vs. 84.9%, P = .009).836 The DEFINE GPS trial (NCT04451044)
is currently investigating the clinical benefit of pre-procedural coronary
pressure mapping with iFR pullback and ‘virtual PCI’ to clarify this issue
further and improve post-PCI clinical outcomes.
Virtual PCI can be conducted by combining anatomical information
from CCTA with that of FFR-CT. FFR-CT/CCTA-based virtual PCI has
two theoretical advantages over ICA-based virtual PCI: (i) it does not re-
quire invasive investigation, and (ii) it provides information on vessel wall/
plaque composition.837 FFR-CT/CCTA-based virtual PCI has been
shown to accurately predict post-PCI FFR838 and to modify PCI proced-
ural planning in 31% of lesions and 45% of patients.839 The Precise
Procedural and PCI Plan (P4) trial (NCT05253677) is currently investi-
gating the clinical benefit of iFR-based virtual PCI to clarify this issue fur-
ther and improve post-PCI clinical outcomes.
coronary artery disease patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
intervention
Three large randomized trials have recently investigated the clinical
benefit of intracoronary imaging during ‘complex’ PCI. One trial,
RENOVATE-COMPLEX PCI,840 mainly investigated the benefit of
IVUS (74% IVUS, 26% OCT), while the two others, OCTOBER810
and ILUMIEN IV,841 investigated the benefit of OCT. Importantly,
while OCTOBER (true bifurcation lesions) and RENOVATE-
COMPLEX PCI (including true bifurcation lesions, long lesions,
chronic total occlusion lesions) focused on ‘anatomically’ complex le-
sions, ILUMIEN IV made the choice to define ‘complexity’ by the clin-
ical context (DM and STEMI/NSTEMI) and/or by the anatomical
characteristics of the lesions.
In RENOVATE-COMPLEX PCI, intravascular imaging-guided PCI led
to a lower risk of a composite of death from a cardiac cause, target
vessel-related MI, or clinically driven target-vessel revascularization
than angiography-guided PCI by 2 years (7.7% vs. 12.3%; HR 0.64;
In OCTOBER, OCT-guided PCI led to a lower risk of a composite of
death from a cardiac cause, target-lesion MI, or ischaemia-driven
target-lesion revascularization than angiography-guided PCI by 2 years
(10.1% vs. 14.1%; HR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50–0.98; P = .035).810 In ILUMIEN
IV, OCT-guided PCI failed to decrease the rate of the primary efficacy
endpoint of target-vessel failure, defined as death from cardiac causes,
target-vessel MI, or ischaemia-driven target-vessel revascularization
(7.4% vs. 8.2%; HR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.67–1.19; P = .45), while the incidence
of definite/probable stent thrombosis was significantly reduced by OCT
guidance vs. angiography guidance (0.5% vs. 1.4%; HR 0.36; 95% CI,
disease patients
Arterial grafting with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the LAD
system and multiple arterial grafting reduces the risk of graft occlusion,
thus increasing the longevity of revascularization efficacy after
CABG.842,843 Hybrid revascularization of multivessel CAD with minim-
ally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB)-LAD plus PCI of
the remaining arteries may represent an alternative option. Hybrid off-
pump revascularization seems a suitable option for patients at moder-
ate-to-high risk for surgery by avoiding the use of cardiopulmonary by-
pass. Despite this attractive concept, the frequency of hybrid
revascularizations remains extremely modest, with about 0.1% of sur-
gical revascularizations.844 Few data are available comparing hybrid re-
vascularization vs. conventional CABG or PCI. Large registry data
report higher rates of bleeding, renal failure, MI, and HF with hybrid re-
vascularization compared with PCI alone,844 while a very small rando-

perform and select revascularization modality
Shared decision-making between patients and healthcare professionals,
based on patient-centred care, is considered a paramount process in
defining the appropriate therapeutic pathway. Essential aspects of
shared decision-making are: a complete and accurate explanation of
the disease; presentation and description of therapeutic options; dis-
cussion of potential risks, benefits, and impact on QoL for each proced-
each step of the post-procedural course and follow-up. Poor shared
decision-making is associated with worse physical and mental out-
comes, lower adherence to therapy, and an increased number of emer-
gency department visits.846–848 Shared decision-making and family
meetings involving relatives increase patient trust in the physicians,
with greater adherence to therapeutic decisions. Shared decision-
making and patient medical education, considering the patient’s charac-
teristics, mental status, cultural beliefs, and educational level, are there-
fore associated with increased patient knowledge and better QoL and
with lower levels of anxiety and depression.849–851
Using lay language and discussion with patients and relatives of short-
term procedure-related and long-term risks and benefits—such as sur-
vival, relief of angina, QoL, the potential need for late reintervention,
the need for prevention measures, and uncertainties associated with
different treatment strategies—are of great importance. Although cur-
rent recommendations are primarily based on the ability of treatments
to reduce adverse events, including improved survival, there is growing
interest in PROMs.852 Patients are not only interested in knowing how
recommended treatment impacts prognosis but also their QoL in the
way they perceive it.853 The patient’s right to decline the treatment op-
tion recommended by the Heart Team must be respected. Patient re-
fusal of a recommended treatment should be acknowledged in a
written document after the patient has received the necessary informa-
tion. In this case, the Heart Team may offer the patient an alternative
treatment option.
The multidisciplinary Heart Team, on site or with partner institutions
(Hub-Spoke institutions)—comprising clinical or non-invasive cardiolo-
gists, cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists, as well as anaes-
thetists or other specialists and healthcare professionals, if deemed
necessary—should provide a balanced multidisciplinary decision-
making process.
Transparency in informed consent is critical, particularly when treat-
ment options are debated. Complex cases, such as patients with CAD
of high anatomic complexity and significant non-cardiac comorbidities,
should be discussed in the Heart Team, taking into consideration other
characteristics not always included in traditional databases, such as
frailty. Heart Team/guideline discordance is common in complex
CAD patients undergoing revascularization, especially in elderly pa-
tients, those with complex coronary disease, and those treated at cen-
tres without cardiac surgery service. These patients have a higher risk of
mid-term mortality.854
In all cases, it is necessary to allow sufficient time to assess all available
information and clearly explain and discuss the findings with each patient.
The rationale for a decision and consensus on the optimal revasculariza-
tion treatment should be documented on the patient’s chart. While the
Heart Team decision is mainly driven by long-term survival benefits with
respected.853,855,856
quality of care
Institutional protocols, developed by the Heart Team and aligned with
the current guidelines, should delineate specific anatomical and func-
tional criteria of disease complexity and specific clinical subsets of pa-
tient’ risk for cardiac surgery or intervention that may or may not be
treated ad hoc. These protocols should be incorporated into clinical
pathways, with regular meetings to assess the applied indications for
myocardial revascularization and monitor the safety and effectiveness
of the procedures, ensuring the quality of delivered patient care.
Collaborative protocols are necessary when cardiac surgery isn’t avail-
able on site, and remote Heart Team meetings should be established.

treatment of specific groups
failure
About half of acute and chronic HF patients have an ischaemic aeti-
ology.880,881 Over the last decades, the proportion of ischaemic
HFrEF has decreased while that of HFpEF, defined according to the
chronic heart failure,526 has increased.882 The evaluation of inducible is-
chaemia is important in patients with HF, given the high prevalence of
CAD.883–885 Moreover, patients with HFpEF may present MVA due to
CMD.886 Indeed, CMD was observed in up to 75% of patients with
HFpEF and was associated with worse diastolic relaxation velocities,
as well as higher filling pressures, and an increased risk of adverse
events.883–885,887–890 Clinical assessment alone may under-estimate
the proportion of patients with obstructive or non-obstructive CAD,
which
can
be
found
in
up
to
of
HFpEF
patients.887
Under-estimation of obstructive CAD leads to failure in identifying
those patients who may benefit from revascularization. Conversely,
in ANOCA patients with preserved LV function, a CFR of <2 was in-
dependently associated with diastolic dysfunction and future MACE, es-
pecially HFpEF events.891 This suggests that CMD and myocardial
stiffness may contribute to HFpEF pathophysiology.892 In HFpEF pa-
tients, functional imaging should, therefore, be considered to detect
CMD and epicardial CAD.
Exercise or pharmacological stress echocardiography can be used
for the assessment of inducible ischaemia and can also help in the dif-
ferential diagnosis of HFpEF.893,894 Stress SPECT or PET can also be
used for the detection of inducible ischaemia. Non-invasive stress
testing can be difficult in patients with HF because of possible exer-
cise intolerance. CCTA is recommended in patients with HF with a
low-to-intermediate pre-test likelihood of obstructive CAD and
those with equivocal non-invasive stress tests, provided there is no
contraindication to contrast administration.894–898 In HFpEF pa-
tients, perfusion PET should be considered for the detection of
CMD.891 In patients with HFrEF and moderate-to-severe inducible
myocardial ischaemia, surgical revascularization improved long-term
survival.54,315 The results of the REVIVED-BCIS2 trial seem to
contradict these findings, as PCI did not reduce mortality or HF hos-
pitalization in patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤
vealed that viability testing did not offer any prognostic benefit.755
The role of myocardial revascularization and viability testing is further
addressed in Section 4.4.2.
In HF patients with anginal (or equivalent) symptoms, despite opti-
mized GDMT, CCTA or ICA is recommended to confirm the diagnosis
of obstructive CAD and its severity.
Over the past three decades, several landmark clinical trials have pro-
vided robust evidence on the prognostic benefit of pharmacological
therapies in patients with HFrEF. In these patients, four drug classes
[ACE-Is or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs),891 beta-
blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and SGLT2
inhibitors] are recommended for outcome improvement regardless
of HF aetiology and comorbidities, including CAD.526
In patients with HFrEF, an ARB is recommended in patients who do
not tolerate ACE-Is or ARNIs. Also, ivabradine should be considered in
addition to the four pillars. It can be used as an alternative to beta-
blockers, when contraindicated or not tolerated, or as additional
antianginal therapy in patients with sinus rhythm and heart rate of
>70 b.p.m.899 Other antianginal drugs (e.g. amlodipine, felodipine, ni-
corandil, trimetazidine, ranolazine, and nitrates) are effective for im-
proving symptoms in patients with HFrEF.546,900–902 Diltiazem and
verapamil increase HF-related events in patients with HFrEF and are
contraindicated.526 In patients with LVEF ≤35% of ischaemic aetiology,
an ICD is strongly recommended for primary prevention; in those with
LVEF ≤35% and QRS >130 ms, CRT needs to be considered.526
Further details regarding the management of patients with HFrEF are
of acute and chronic heart failure.526
In patients with HFpEF, in addition to diuretics for treating conges-
tion, SGLT2 inhibitors are now recommended for outcome improve-
ment.709 Additionally, beta-blockers, long-acting nitrates, CCBs,
ivabradine, ranolazine, trimetazidine, nicorandil, and their combinations
should be considered in patients with HFpEF and CAD for angina relief,
but without foreseen benefits on HF and coronary endpoints.
Low-dose rivaroxaban may be considered in patients with CAD and
HF, LVEF of >40%, and sinus rhythm when at high risk of stroke and
with low haemorrhagic risk.526,903,904
Evidence and recommendations for myocardial revascularization in
patients with HF are reported in Section 4.4.2. Notably, patients with
advanced HF may be candidates for LV assistance devices and/or heart
transplantation.526
During of high-risk PCI for complex CAD905 in patients with HFrEF,
mechanical cardiac support, such as the microaxial flow pump, may min-
imize the risk of severe complications and provide haemodynamic stabil-
ity, facilitating the achievement of complete revascularization.906,907

non-obstructive coronary arteries
A large proportion of patients undergoing coronary angiography be-
cause of angina do not have obstructive epicardial coronary arteries
(ANOCA). In these patients, the prevalence of demonstrable ischaemia
(INOCA) varies, depending on the stress test performed, between 10%
and 30% (Figure 12).926–928 Angina/ischaemia with non-obstructive cor-
onary arteries is more frequent among women (approximately 50% to
between blood supply and myocardial oxygen demands leading to an-
gina and ischaemia in ANOCA/INOCA may be caused by CMD and/
or epicardial coronary artery spasm.36 However, these conditions are
rarely correctly diagnosed, and, therefore, no tailored therapy is pre-
scribed for these patients. As a consequence, these patients continue
to experience recurrent angina with poor QoL, leading to repeated
hospitalizations, unnecessary repeat coronary angiography, and adverse
cardiovascular outcomes in the short and long term.36
coronary arteries endotypes
Invasive functional coronary testing using Ach and adenosine in indivi-
duals suspected of CCS and with non-obstructive coronary arteries en-
ables the differentiation of the following endotypes: (i) endothelial
dysfunction; (ii) impaired vasodilation (low coronary flow reserve and/
or high microvascular resistance); (iii) epicardial vasospastic angina;
(iv) microvascular vasospastic angina; (v) endotype combinations; (vi)
equivocal response, i.e. angina without fulfilling any endotype criteria.37,38
The prevalence of ANOCA and INOCA in relation to the presence of
the endotypes is shown in Figure 12. Angina with non-obstructive cor-
onary arteries occurs in up to 70% of the patients undergoing ICA, of
whom 25% have documented ischaemia (INOCA). Among the patients
who are tested with Ach, 80% show endothelial dysfunction, 60% have
MVA/VSA, and 50% have an impaired CFR and/or high microvascular
resistance.38,927,930,931 This emphasizes the importance of testing not
only patients with INOCA but also all patients with ANOCA to deter-
mine the final endotype so that appropriate treatment can be initiated.
In patients with HFpEF with persistent angina or equivalent symptoms and normal or non-obstructive epicardial coronary arteries, PET
or CMR perfusion or invasive coronary functional testing should be considered to detect or rule out coronary microvascular
dysfunction.883–885,887–889

Microvascular angina is the clinical manifestation of myocardial ischaemia
caused by structural or functional changes in the coronary microvascula-
ture (leading to impaired CFR and/or reduced microcirculatory conduct-
ance) and/or abnormal vasoconstriction of coronary arterioles (causing
dynamic arteriolar obstruction).932,933 Both vascular dysfunction me-
chanisms may co-exist and contribute to MVA.
The prevalence of MVA was 26% in a study of patients with
non-obstructive CAD who had a CFVR below 2 when assessed by
transthoracic Doppler echocardiography.934 Studies assessing CMD in-
vasively or by PET with different cut-offs have found that 39% to 54%
had CMD.935,936 The threshold for CMD varies between studies and
depending on the techniques used (PET, CMR, thermodilution, or
Doppler); the threshold is a CFR of <2.0–2.5.36,39 A thermodilution
CFR of <2.0 has low sensitivity for identifying CMD, but using the
same threshold as for Doppler (<2.5) results in reasonable diagnostic
accuracy.937
Smoking, age, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia are associated
with CMD.934,935,938 Other studies have shown that diabetes was un-
common among patients with angina and non-obstructive CAD, while
hypertension and dyslipidaemia were relatively more prevalent.939,940
Inflammatory conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
and rheumatoid arthritis appear to be associated with MVA and are
not infrequently encountered in patients with angina.941 Inflammatory
diseases occur more often in women after menopause than in men,
which may contribute to the sex differences in MVA.942–944 Last, but
not least, there is increasing evidence that psychosocial stress is involved
in coronary vasomotor disorders.945,946

referred for invasive coronary angiography and functional testing. Endothelial dysfunction is present in 80% and an acetylcholine test is positive in 60% of
these patients. An impaired CFR (≤2.5), measured by i.c. Doppler guidewires, is present in 50%, while ischaemia (INOCA) is documented by non-
invasive functional testing in only 25% of ANOCA patients. The prevalence of coronary vasospasm can vary in different studies depending on dose
of acetylcholine and test protocol. aPrevalence of ischaemia by non-invasive functional testing increases from non-obstructive to obstructive CAD.
Vasospastic angina is the clinical manifestation of myocardial ischaemia
caused by abnormal vasoconstriction of one or more epicardial coron-
ary arteries leading to a dynamic coronary obstruction. Standardized
diagnostic criteria for VSA have been defined.73 Microvascular angina
and epicardial VSA can co-exist, which is associated with a worse prog-
nosis.947 Concomitant endothelial dysfunction is prevalent in most pa-
tients with INOCA with inducible coronary artery spasm and/or
impaired adenosine-mediated vasodilation.38,948
The Japanese population has a higher prevalence of coronary vaso-
spasm than Western populations. In addition, the frequencies of mul-
tiple coronary spasms (≥2 spastic arteries) by provocative testing in
Japanese (24.3%) and Taiwanese populations (19.3%) are markedly
higher than those in Caucasians (7.5%).949–951
Angina/ischaemia with non-obstructive coronary arteries is associated
with a wide variation in its clinical presentation, and symptom burden
may vary over time. Failure to diagnose epicardial obstructive CAD in
a patient with documented ischaemia should stimulate a subsequent
search pathway to elucidate ANOCA/INOCA endotypes.
Symptoms of angina/ischaemia with non-obstructive coronary arteries
are associated with adverse physical, mental, and social health.952
Angina/ischaemia with non-obstructive coronary arteries is associated
with poor QoL, higher risk of disability, and a higher incidence of ad-
verse events, including mortality, morbidity, healthcare costs, recurrent
hospital readmissions and repeat coronary angiograms.300,953–958 The
incidence of all-cause death and non-fatal MI in patients with non-
obstructive atherosclerosis was higher than in those with angiographi-
cally normal epicardial vessels.298,959–961 Proven myocardial ischaemia
by stress echocardiography or nuclear imaging was associated with a
higher incidence of events compared with ischaemia detected by exer-
cise electrocardiographic stress testing.958 There is a two- to four-fold
higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with MVA
diagnosed by PET or transthoracic echocardiography and a two-fold
higher risk in patients with epicardial endothelial-dependent dysfunc-
tion.300,962 Microvascular angina due to impaired CFR was associated
with increased major adverse cardiac events and target-vessel failure
rates over a 5-year follow-up period.931 Vasospastic angina is associated
with major adverse events, including sudden cardiac death, acute MI,
and syncope.963 In a group of ANOCA/INOCA patients, abnormal
non-invasive testing did not allow the identification of patients with a
higher risk of long-term cardiovascular events. However, adding intra-
coronary physiological assessment to non-invasive information allowed
the identification of patient subgroups with up to a four-fold difference
in long-term cardiovascular events.357
The presence of myocardial ischaemia on functional imaging without
obstructive CAD on CCTA or ICA should always raise the clinical sus-
picion of ANOCA/INOCA. The diagnosis of ANOCA/INOCA is exclu-
sively based on invasive functional evaluation of the coronary
microcirculation, given that no technique allows direct visualization of
the coronary microcirculation in vivo in humans. Several non-invasive
and invasive tests have been established to assess the coronary micro-
vascular function (Figure 13).6,41,964,965
Non-invasive tests (stress echocardiography, PET, perfusion CCTA, and
CMR) allow diagnosing ANOCA/INOCA by measuring the CFR.41
These techniques have an excellent negative predictive value, but the
positive predictive value is an issue for most, as obstructive CAD needs
to be ruled out before the diagnosis of CMD can be made. Only hybrid
techniques such as CCTA with perfusion and PET-CT offer combined
imaging of the epicardial coronary arteries and functional testing of the
coronary microcirculation in a single test.6,964
Invasive coronary functional testing consists of a comprehensive
evaluation of the coronary circulation in a single procedure by combin-
ing angiography, direct invasive assessment of the coronary haemo-
dynamics by intracoronary pressure and flow measurement either by
thermodilution
(bolus/continuous)
or
Doppler
techniques,
and
pharmacological vasomotor testing. Recently, a standardized protocol
has been proposed.36
and flow measurements allow assessment of the haemodynamic signifi-
cance of focal or diffuse coronary lesions by measuring FFR or iFR (see
IMR, HMR, or MRR361,961 (see Section 3.3.3.3). Coronary microvascular
dysfunction is characterized by decreased CFR and increased microvascu-
lar vascular resistance (IMR, HMR, MRR). Decreased CFR can be due to
structural or functional microvascular dysfunction.926,966 Functional CMD
is characterized by increased resting flow linked to enhanced nitric oxide
synthase (NOS) activity, whereas patients with structural CMD have
endothelial dysfunction, leading to a reduced increase of coronary blood
flow during exercise.926,966
A Doppler-derived CFR of <2.5 in non-obstructive CAD indicates
an
abnormal
microcirculatory
response
corresponding
to
a
thermodilution-derived CFR of <2.5.361,926,937,961 Of note, in assessing
coronary microvascular function, continuous thermodilution showed
significantly less variability than bolus thermodilution on repeated mea-
surements.382 An increased IMR (≥25) indicates microvascular dysfunc-
tion.380,381 For the Doppler-derived HMR, a value of >2.5 mmHg/cm/s
indicates augmented microvascular resistance.42 Recently, MRR has
been considered abnormal for values <2.7.364,967 Doppler flow analysis
allows assessment of the flow-recovery time after Ach administration
as a sign of myocardial ischaemia, which is helpful in the diagnosis of pa-
tients with equivocal test results.968
endothelium-dependent vasodilation and vasospasm are tested by in-
tracoronary bolus administration or graded infusion of Ach, first at a
low dose/grade to assess endothelial dysfunction at the microvascular
or epicardial level, and after that at a higher dose/grade to eventually in-
duce microvascular or/and epicardial coronary vasospasm. The LAD ar-
tery is usually preferred as the pre-specified target vessel reflecting its
subtended myocardial mass and coronary dominance. The left circum-
flex coronary artery is also tested if Ach is administered in the LMCA.
Additional studies in the right coronary artery may be appropriate if the
initial tests are negative and clinical suspicion is high. As Ach exerts a
cholinergic effect on the atrioventricular node, significant bradycardia
may ensue if infused especially in the right coronary artery or a domin-
ant left circumflex coronary artery. Bradycardia can be prevented by se-
lective infusion in the LAD, prophylactic ventricular pacing, or reduction
of the concentration infused or of the injected dose. If necessary, the
bradycardia effect of Ach can be antagonized by atropine. The effect of
Ach is short in contrast to the prolonged effect of ergonovine, which
was previously used for the provocation of coronary vasospasm.969
The diagnosis of MVA and VSA due to microvascular or macrovascular
vasospasm is made according to established criteria.41,73,932 The test is
considered positive for macrovascular spasm if symptoms occur,
accompanied by ischaemic ECG changes and an angiographic ≥90% re-
duction of the coronary lumen. If the lumen reduction is <90%, the diag-
nosis of microvascular spasm is made. The vasospastic effect of Ach is
rapidly transient and can, if needed, be reversed by intracoronary admin-
istration
of
nitroglycerine,

the risk of inducing polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.975,976
Different protocols have been applied in clinical practice. Figure 14

nosing vasospasm. Informed consent should be obtained, mentioning
unlicensed, parenteral use of Ach, and administration performed by

non-obstructive coronary arteries
Management should be patient-centred with a patient-oriented multi-
disciplinary care approach.977 Figure 15 provides an algorithm for the
therapeutic management of ANOCA/INOCA. In all patients with es-
tablished ANOCA/INOCA due to the frequent presence of coronary
atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction, tailored counselling on life-
style factors is warranted to address risk factors, reduce symptoms, and
improve QoL and prognosis. Management of traditional CVD risk fac-
tors, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, and diabetes should be as
per clinical practice guidelines recommendations.
Treatment of anginal symptoms in patients with ANOCA/INOCA is
challenging as the patients represent a heterogeneous group and rando-
mized trials are lacking. A small study showed that a stratified antianginal
therapy algorithm based on coronary functional testing resulted in im-
proved angina symptoms and QoL compared with a control group
treated with standard therapy.978 In patients with MVA and reduced
CFR and/or increased IMR (which may reflect arteriolar remodelling),
beta-blockers, CCBs, ranolazine, and ACE-Is are used.979 In these pa-
tients, anti-ischaemic therapy with amlodipine or ranolazine resulted
in a significant improvement in exercise time.980 In patients with either
epicardial or microvascular spasm following Ach testing, calcium an-
tagonists should be considered as first-line therapy. In patients with se-
vere VSA, it may be necessary to administer unusually high dosages of
calcium antagonist (2 × 200 mg diltiazem daily or higher up to 960 mg
daily) or even a combination of non-dihydropyridine (such as diltiazem)
with dihydropyridine calcium blockers (such as amlodipine). Of note, a
small study using either oral diltiazem or placebo up to 360 mg/day in
CMD for 6 weeks did not substantially improve symptoms or QoL,
but diltiazem therapy did reduce the prevalence of epicardial spasm.981
Nicorandil, a combinatorial vasodilator agent acting via nitrate- and
potassium-channel activation, may be an effective alternative, although
side effects are frequent.982 First-line therapy can also be combined

Between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the world’s population
aged >60 years is set to nearly double to 22%. Ageing predisposes
patients to a high incidence and prevalence of CAD, in both men
and women. Typically, in the context of CVD, older patients are de-
fined as those ≥75 years of age;1 it should be noted, however, that
such age cut-offs are relatively arbitrary, and biological age influences
this threshold in clinical practice. Clinical characteristics of the older
adult population are heterogeneous, with frailty, comorbidity, cogni-
tive function, and health-related QoL playing important roles in guid-
ing clinical care and as predictors of adverse outcomes.1001–1005
Older patients often present with symptoms other than angina,
which may delay the diagnosis of CCS.1004
Ageing is often accompanied by both comorbidities and frailty, and
consequently leads to potentially excessive polypharmacy.531 In mak-
ing treatment decisions, clinicians should take into account the lim-
ited external validity of RCTs for older adults.36 Older people are
often underrepresented in RCTs as a consequence of exclusion cri-
teria and under-recruitment,531,1006,1007 though they have been
shown to have a higher underlying risk for cardiovascular out-
comes.1008 The treatment of CCS in older adults is complicated by
a higher vulnerability to complications for both conservative and in-
vasive strategies, such as bleeding, renal failure, and neurological im-
pairments, all of which require special attention. The use of DES,
compared with bare-metal stents, in combination with a short dur-
ation of DAPT, is associated with significant safety and efficacy ben-
efits in older adults.1009 Frailty is of utmost importance in the clinical
decision-making.1010

compared with men could contribute to unfavourable outcomes. There
are also risk factors that are unique to women.1014,1015 Not only prema-
ture menopause,1016 but also hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,
pre-term delivery, gestational diabetes, small-for-gestational-age delivery,
placental abruption, and pregnancy loss are predictors of subsequent
CVD.1017 Also, the association between low socioeconomic status and
increased cardiovascular risk seems stronger in women.1018 In addition,
higher levels of residential segregation are associated with incident
CVD and obesity among black women.1019
Women are less likely to be referred for diagnostic testing and are
under-treated

prevention
therapies.1020
Compared with men, women have a shorter survival after PCI1021
and CABG.1022 In a large-scale, individual-patient data pooled analysis
of contemporary PCI trials with early and new-generation DES, women
had a higher risk of MACE and ischaemia-driven target-lesion revascu-
larization compared with men at 5 years following PCI.1021 However,
the excess risk after PCI among women can be primarily explained
by a greater burden of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbid condi-
tions.1023 Nevertheless, in a population undergoing contemporary PCI,
women and men had similar risks of death or new Q-wave MI at 2 years,
but women faced a higher risk of bleeding and haemorrhagic stroke
compared with men.1024
Women with signs and symptoms suggestive of cardiac ischaemia
should be investigated carefully. The same guideline-recommended car-
diovascular preventive therapy should be provided to women and
men.1025 Hormone replacement therapy in post-menopausal women
does not reduce the risk of ischaemic myocardial disease1015 and it
may come at the cost of other health risks,1026 which should be dis-
cussed with the patient.
An HBR is increasingly present in many CCS patients referred for cor-
onary revascularization. The ARC-HBR consortium provided a consist-
ent definition of HBR for patients undergoing PCI. Patients are
considered at HBR if at least one major or two minor criteria are
met.590 In the context of PCI in HBR patients, short duration of
DAPT (1–3 months) and PCI with a DES was beneficial in many recent
studies.1009,1027–1032
Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases have an increased risk of
CVD compared with the general population.1033,1034 Accumulating evi-
dence has shown elevated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in
other rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases, including gout, vasculitis,
systemic sclerosis, myositis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjögren
syndrome, SLE, and the antiphospholipid syndrome.1035–1044
Some of these patient categories have two- to three-fold higher pre-
valences of asymptomatic ASCVD compared with the general popula-
tion,1045–1051 which is linked to ASCVD outcomes.1049,1052–1054 Thus,
identification of ASCVD such as carotid artery plaque(s) may be consid-
ered in ASCVD and CAD risk evaluation.1050,1055–1057
In patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases and CCS, CVD
preventive medications such as lipid-lowering medications and antihy-
pertensive treatment should be used as in the general popula-
tion.1058–1062
Blood pressure lowering has been associated with favourable cardio-
vascular outcomes in patients regardless of the presence of CAD.1063
Due to concerns of a possible J-curve relationship between achieved
BP and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CAD, previous guide-
lines did not recommend a target BP of <120/70 mmHg. In line with the
mend that treated systolic BP values in most CCS patients be targeted
to 120–129 mmHg, provided the treatment is well tolerated. In cases
where on-treatment systolic BP is at or below target (120–129
mmHg) but diastolic BP is not at target (≥80 mmHg), intensifying
BP-lowering treatment to achieve an on-treatment diastolic BP of
ent targets (e.g. 140/90 mmHg) can be considered in older patients
(≥85 years of age) or patients with pre-treatment symptomatic
orthostatic hypotension. In hypertensive patients with a history of
MI, beta-blockers and RAS blockers are first-line treatments. In
patients with symptomatic angina, beta-blockers and/or CCBs can
be useful.1065
Diagnostic assessment of CAD (CCTA and non-invasive tests) may be
difficult in AF with a high ventricular rate. In patients with CAD and AF,
rhythm or rate control strategies may help improve symptoms of myo-
cardial ischaemia. Amiodarone or dronedarone are drugs of choice for
rhythm control, as an alternative to catheter ablation, in patients with
CAD and AF. Sotalol may also be considered. Beta-blockers, diltiazem,
verapamil, or digoxin can be used for rate control depending on the
LVEF.613 After PCI, combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies
are needed. Recommendations on post-PCI antithrombotic therapy
in patients with AF and indication for OAC are detailed in Section
AF during isolated CABG seems to be safe and effective in improving
long-term outcomes.1066 Concomitant surgical closure of the left atrial
appendage is recommended as an adjunct to oral anticoagulation in
patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery (e.g. CABG) to prevent is-
chaemic stroke and thrombo-embolism (see the ESC 2024 Guidelines
for the management of Atrial Fibrillation).1067
In patients with valvular heart disease with a risk for associated CAD
who require surgery or in whom a decision of a percutaneous or sur-
gical approach is still pending, ICA or CCTA is recommended to deter-
mine the need for coronary revascularization.1068 Evidence of CAD in
patients with valvular heart disease can drive to a surgical instead of a
percutaneous treatment of valvular heart disease. Invasive coronary
angiography is recommended in patients with secondary mitral regur-
gitation as this condition is frequently due to ischaemic LV dysfunc-
tion.1068 Routine stress testing to detect CAD associated with severe
symptomatic valvular heart disease is not recommended because of
low diagnostic value and potential risk. The usefulness of FFR or iFR
in patients with valvular heart disease is not well established, and cau-
tion is warranted in interpreting these measurements, especially in
the presence of aortic stenosis.1068 Beta-blockers need to be used
with caution in patients with aortic valve disease. Coronary artery by-
pass grafting is recommended in patients with a primary indication for
aortic/mitral/tricuspid valve surgery and significant coronary stenosis.
Percutaneous coronary intervention should be considered in patients
with a primary indication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation
or transcatheter mitral valve intervention and coronary artery diameter
stenosis of >70% in proximal segments.1068
Chronic kidney disease increases the risk of CAD progression and is as-
sociated with high mortality rates due to cardiovascular causes.1069,1070
Patients with CKD have a higher burden of atherosclerosis and more
advanced plaque features.1070 Despite the higher prevalence of disease,
non-invasive diagnostic testing is often less accurate, and guidance re-
lated to the use of pharmacological and interventional therapy is limited
due to inconsistent definitions of CKD and underrepresentation of
CKD patients in clinical trials.1070–1072
Careful assessment of the risk-to-benefit ratio is needed in patients
with CKD before considering ICA, CCTA, or non-invasive tests requir-
ing nephrotoxic agents.1073 Pre-existing CKD is the primary patient-
related risk factor for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI),
whereas DM increases the susceptibility to develop AKI. The most im-
portant measures to prevent AKI are using the lowest necessary total
dose of low-osmolality or iso-osmolality contrast medium and suffi-
cient pre- and post-hydration.1073
CKD raises the risks associated with both CABG and PCI.316 The
ISCHEMIA-CKD trial included patients with advanced CKD [estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or dialysis]
and CCS with moderate or severe myocardial ischaemia detected by
stress test. An invasive strategy of ICA and PCI was not superior to con-
servative management in reducing the primary endpoint of death or
non-fatal MI.1074
In a propensity score-matched analysis involving 5920 CKD patients
(2960 pairs), PCI utilizing second-generation DES displayed a reduced
risk of death, stroke, and repeat revascularization at 30 days when com-
pared with CABG.1075 However, PCI was associated with a higher risk
of repeat revascularization over the long term. Conversely, among pa-
tients on dialysis, the findings favoured CABG over PCI. Additionally, a
meta-analysis of 11 registries revealed lower rates of death, MI, and re-
peat revascularization with CABG in contrast to PCI among patients
with eGFR of <60 mL/min/1.73 m².1076 Nevertheless, there is a notable
absence of large RCTs comparing revascularization modalities among
CKD patients.
Several cancer treatments are associated with an increased risk of CCS.
Spontaneous bleeding in ACS and CCS patients has been associated
with subsequent cancer diagnosis.1077 A prompt evaluation of bleeding
may be useful to enable an early detection of cancer. The management
of CCS is similar in patients with and without cancer. However, deci-
sions regarding coronary revascularization should be undertaken by a
multidisciplinary team. The approach should be individualized and based
on life expectancy, additional comorbidities such as thrombocyto-
paenia, increased thrombosis, or bleeding risk, and potential interac-
tions between drugs used in CCS management and anticancer
therapy.1078,1079
immunodeficiency virus
Patientswithhumanimmunodeficiencyvirus(HIV)havelongerlifeexpect-
ancy than before due to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), but are
twice as likely to develop CVD compared with the general population.1080
The long-term CVD outcomes in patients with HIV may change, given the
relatively recent epidemiological transition of HIV to a chronic disease.
Dyslipidaemia is a common condition in patients with HIV, whether trea-
ted or untreated with ART.1081 The treatment of dyslipidaemia in patients
withHIVincludesbothnon-pharmacologicalandpharmacological options.
Special attention to the impact of polypharmacy, drug interactions be-
tween ART and lipid-lowering medications, and close monitoring for ad-
verse events is critical to successfully managing dyslipidaemia and risk of
CVD in patients with HIV. Hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) me-
tabolizes many statins; many ARTs are also metabolized by CYP3A4 and,
thus,may have interactions with statins. Simvastatin and lovastatin arecon-
traindicated with protease inhibitors; atorvastatin has less of a CYP3A4
interaction; pravastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin and rosuvastatin are not
or minimally metabolized through CYP3A4.1082,1083 Ezetimibe has no in-
teractions with CYP3A4 or ART.1081
A clinical trial investigating the impact of PCSK9 inhibitor therapy on
lipids, inflammatory markers, and subclinical ASCVD (including non-
calcified plaque and arterial inflammation) in HIV is currently being con-
ducted [EPIC-HIV study (Effect of PCSK9 Inhibition on Cardiovascular
Risk in Treated HIV Infection), NCT03207945]. Future studies are
needed to evaluate the impact of PCSK9 inhibition on clinical events
in HIV.
A lower socioeconomic status has implications of increased CVD mor-
tality1084 and poorer CVD risk factor profiles.1085 A multicohort study
of 1.7 million adults followed up for any cause of death for an average of
years.1086 Education level, occupation, household income, health, dis-
ability, and living conditions also contribute to socioeconomic status.
There were different rates of decline in mortality from CVD in
Europe between the most and the least deprived.1087 It has been pro-
posed that on this basis, CVD could become a disease prevalently of the
lower socioeconomic groups by the mid-2020s.1088
Black patients with diabetes have a higher hospitalization burden
with a concomitant disparity in comorbid presentation and outcome
compared with other patients with diabetes.1089 South Asian ethnicity,
even after adjustment for traditional risk factors, is associated with an
increased risk of coronary heart disease outcomes. This risk was great-
er than other studied racial/ethnic groups and second only to diabetes
in coronary heart disease risk prediction.1090
Within a large prospective study, South Asian individuals had a
substantially higher risk of ASCVD than individuals of European
ancestry.1091 South Asians have a more diffuse pattern with multives-
sel involvement. However, less is known about other morphological
characteristics, such as atherosclerotic plaque composition and
coronary diameter in South Asian populations. Despite a similar cor-
onary calcification burden, higher non-calcified plaque contribution,
elevated thrombosis, and inflammatory markers likely contribute to
the disease pattern. Although the current evidence on the role of cor-
onary vessel size remains inconsistent, smaller diameters in South
Asians could play a potential role in the higher disease prevalence.1092
Individuals of South Asian descent have a high prevalence of CYP2C19
loss-of-function alleles (poor metabolizers: 13% vs. 2.4% in European
populations),1093 which are associated with reduced efficacy of
clopidogrel.
in asymptomatic individuals
Presence of asymptomatic atherosclerotic CAD is common in the gen-
eral population.1097–1100 In the Swedish Cardiopulmonary Bioimage
Study, CCTA was performed in randomly selected individuals from
the general population.1097 In the 25 182 individuals without known
CAD, atherosclerotic plaque was present in 42% of participants.
Plaque was more common in older individuals and in males (males
sent in 5% of participants. In the PESA study (Progression of Early
Subclinical Atherosclerosis), 63% of asymptomatic middle-aged partici-
pants had subclinical atherosclerosis,157 although most of them were
categorized as low-risk individuals by several risk scores.142
The risk of adverse events in asymptomatic subjects can be estimated
using the European risk-estimation system [Systematic Coronary Risk
diovascular disease prevention in clinical practice.16,1101 Systematic
screening of risk factors cannot be strongly recommended in the general
population as it did not affect CVD outcomes.1102 However, when pa-
tients are seen for other reasons, opportunistic screening is effective at
increasing detection rates of CVD risk factors, such as high BP or lipids.
Hence, opportunistic screening is recommended, although its beneficial
effect on clinical outcomes remains uncertain.1103
Information on CAC can be used to guide risk-factor management, and
initiate lipid-lowering and antithrombotic treatment in patients with esti-
mated future risk around treatment decision thresholds.1104 To date, two
randomized screening studies have indicated that statin therapy impacts
outcomes when guided by CACS in younger patients with high
CACS.1105,1106 Coronary artery calcium score could potentially guide
not only risk-factor management but also primary prophylaxis with as-
pirin, but randomized studies are lacking.1107 Importantly, opportunistic
screening of the burden of calcified atherosclerotic CAD can be accurate-
ly accessed with non-ECG-gated chest CT performed for other rea-
sons.17,1108 Reporting the visual interpretation of the coronary plaque
burden according to a simple score with four categories (none, mild,
moderate, severe) is recommended.1108–1110 However, there is no
current evidence to support further diagnostic imaging in asymptomatic
individuals on the basis of presence of calcified plaque alone.
Carotid ultrasound,1111 aortic pulse wave velocity, arterial augmen-

sive for these modalities compared with CACS.

A diagnosis of CCS can have an impact on self-identity, lifestyle, employ-
ment, and cause anxiety, depression, and burdensome treatment.
Patients are experts in their own conditions, and their voices and pre-
ferences are integral to decisions about treatment. Health outcomes
improve with better patient involvement, and shared decision-making
is central to future patient care.1113
Communication is essential to support patients’ understanding, adher-
ence, and engagement in decision-making.1114 Good communication
requires providing information at an appropriate level, active listening,
assessing patient understanding, and determining patient perspectives
and priorities. A meta-analysis summarizing a total of 127 studies of
communication training concluded that patients were 19% more likely
to be non-adherent when physicians had poor communication, and
received communication training.1115 Communication and shared
decision-making can be particularly challenging when patients have co-
morbidities, low health literacy, language differences, cognitive impair-
ment, depression, or anxiety, and when evidence for treatment is less
robust.
Patient reported outcome measures can be useful to improve as-
sessment and communication of symptoms, function, and QoL, and
can highlight problems that may not have been previously discussed.
Under- and overestimation of symptoms can lead to a lack of or in-
appropriate treatment.1116,1117 The routine use of PROMs in clinical
practice is hampered by the challenge of interpretation of scores and
their integration into routine clinical processes.1116
Although quality of communication can be improved through train-
ing, meta-analyses have not found evidence of significant impact on out-
comes such as physical or mental health, satisfaction, QoL, or specific
risk
factors
in
patients
with
cancer,
diabetes,
and
hyperten-
sion.1115,1118,1119 Structured tools and a flexible range of resources (in-
cluding videos, workbooks, and health-literacy materials) that provide
individualized information and decision aids can be adjuncts to better
communication and shared decision-making.443 A systematic review
of 17 RCTs of tools to support decision-making in severe illness con-
cluded that they improved patient knowledge and readiness to make
decisions.1120
Communicating the risk of future CVD events and how risk can be
lowered through lifestyle and medications is best presented using visual
or imaging approaches, natural frequencies rather than percentages,
and positive framing (focusing on risk-reduction benefits).1121–1125
Relative risk reduction is more persuasive than either absolute risk re-
duction or the number needed to treat.1122 The use of risk prediction
estimates may have an impact on individuals’ health when their informa-
tion (i.e. predicted risk stratification) changes individuals’ behaviour,
self-management decisions, and even treatment decisions.446 This en-
ables patients to gain insights into their cardiovascular prognosis and
to empower them to take part in the decision-making process.1126
This approach may increase self-motivation for therapy adherence
and lifestyle changes, including changes in nutrition, physical activity,
relaxation training, weight management, and participation in smoking
cessation programmes for resistant smokers.446 Previous unsuccessful
attempts to
change to a
healthy lifestyle or take guideline-
recommended treatment can be addressed to set realistic goals.446
Communication should be clear regarding symptoms, even if not car-
diac. Patients with CCS experiencing non-cardiac chest pain experience
uncertainty about the cause and actions to take. A multidisciplinary ap-
proach and evaluation of non-cardiac aetiology with an appropriate re-
ferral are advocated to ensure that appropriate treatment is
initiated.1127,1128
Depression is common (15%–20% prevalence) in CVD, and associated
with poor adherence and worse outcomes, including MACE and pre-
mature death.1129 Coronary microvascular dysfunction (prevalent in
INOCA) is linked with psychological stress and depression.946
Unfortunately, depression and psychological stress are often unrecog-
nized due to a lack of systematic screening using validated tools.1129 For
anxiety, a recent meta-analysis involving 16 studies reported a preva-
lence in post-MI between 5.5% and 58%, and a 27% greater risk of
poor clinical outcomes in anxious patients compared with those with-
out anxiety.1130 In contrast, in a 15-year follow-up of 1109 patients with
CCS moderate anxiety did not increase the risk of cardiovascular
events compared with low anxiety levels. Patients on a high but de-
creasing anxiety trajectory had an HR of 1.72 (95% CI, 1.11–2.68) for
cardiovascular events.1131 Treatment of psychosocial factors, depres-
sion, and anxiety with pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and/or exer-
cise can improve symptoms and QoL in some patients, and there is
some evidence for improvement in cardiac outcomes.472,1132–1134
bination of therapies may be more efficacious.1129,1135 First-line treat-
ment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (recommended in
CCS) or non-pharmacological interventions and a multidisciplinary col-
laborative approach are recommended.1129
Earlier analyses reported that adherence to long-term therapies in
chronic conditions in Western countries averaged 50% and was lower
in developing countries.1136 Pooled prevalence of non-adherence from
a recent meta-analysis of eight studies (n = 3904 patients with multimor-
bidity) was 42.63% (95% CI, 34%–51%).1137 Data from the ESC-EORP
EUROASPIRE V registry indicate that many CCS patients still have un-
healthy lifestyles in terms of smoking, diet, and sedentary behaviour.1138
Poor adherence and persistence (duration of time in which medications
and healthy behaviours are continued) have a profound effect on effect-
ive management, patient safety, and outcomes. The World Health
Organization (WHO) advocates training in adherence for healthcare
professionals, a multidisciplinary approach, support rather than blame,
tailored interventions based on illness-related demands for each patient,
and viewing adherence as a dynamic process.1136
The five dimensions of adherence are patient, disease, provider, ther-
apy, and healthcare system (Figure 16).1139 Therefore, identifying pa-
tients at risk of non-adherence, addressing all five dimensions,
developing a multidisciplinary pathway to support sustained adherence,
and a follow-up strategy are essential steps.1139
Different strategies may help improve long-term adherence to a
healthy lifestyle (Figure 17).
Making changes to unhealthy lifestyles and controlling risk factors can
be a daunting task as these are usually longstanding habits and patterns
of behaviour. Habits and environmental cues primarily govern beha-
viours, so education and information alone are seldom enough.1140
Factors such as psychological state and low health literacy (associated
with depression and worse behavioural risk factors) also impact the
ability to make changes.1141,1142
A multidisciplinary approach and behavioural counselling can improve
adherence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 RCTs of
nurse-led patient-centred interventions for secondary prevention
found greater adherence to smoking cessation and physical activity,
and better control of total cholesterol (with medication titration),
but no improvements in dietary habits, BP, blood glucose, or sur-
vival.1143 A systematic review of behavioural counselling found that
medium- to high-contact counselling resulted in 20% lower risk of
CVD events, lower BP, and decreased LDL-C and adiposity in adults
with CVD risk factors.1144 Incorporating cardiovascular visual images
into risk-factor discussions is effective in reducing subsequent 10-year
risk assessment and individual risk factors.445

Lifestyle changes also impact relatives, partners, and friends, so they
should be involved in patient support.1139 Physical activity can be incor-
porated flexibly, either daily, or limited to specific days. Activity pat-
terns limited to 1–2 sessions per week but meeting recommended
levels of physical activity have been shown to reduce or postpone
all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality risk.477 Importantly, maintaining
changed behaviour over time is a challenge. Some trials have shown
an impact of lifestyle intervention on cardiovascular health and behav-
ioural metrics, which became attenuated in the long term as the inten-
sity of the intervention declined.1145
Behavioural change and habit formation can be facilitated through tech-
nology such as wearable devices, the internet, and smartphones. In 27
studies including 5165 patients with CAD or cerebrovascular disease,
text messaging and smartphone apps resulted in a greater ability to
reach BP targets and exercise goals, less anxiety, and increased aware-
ness of diet and exercise compared with control.1146 Nevertheless,
there was no significant difference in smoking cessation, LDL-C, and
hospital readmissions.1146 Digital interventions mainly stimulate healthy
behavioural factors but are less effective in reducing unhealthy behav-
ioural factors (smoking, alcohol intake, sedentary behaviour, and un-
healthy diet) and clinical outcomes.1146,1147
The use of wearable devices has significantly increased physical activ-
ity and decreased waist circumference, systolic BP, and LDL-C among
individuals with chronic conditions including CVD.491 Younger age
has been associated with a higher increase in physical activity, and
CVD has been associated with a lower increase. Wearable activity
trackers have shown effectiveness, but the effect was greater when

combined with other behaviour-change strategies.491 A systematic re-
view of CCS patients that used activity trackers combined with feed-
back by healthcare professionals (most also giving lifestyle education)
showed a significant increase in peak VO2 in studies using an acceler-
ometer (but not a pedometer) compared with non-users. The overall
effect across studies reduced MACE and improved QoL.1148 Similarly,
smartphone and tablet computer apps have been shown to increase
physical activity (minutes per week or steps per day) among people
with CVD (1543 participants, most of them with CCS). This effect
was largest in small studies focused on physical activity only, partici-
pants ≥60 years old, and duration of up to 3 months.1149
Adherence to the apps was 20% to 85% and tended to wane over
time. Of note, the implementation of digital and mHealth should
not be at odds with a less digital-oriented care for those unfamiliar
with new technologies (e.g. elderly people).
Addressing lifestyle behaviour and medication adherence in a non-
judgemental way at clinical encounters is important to identify barriers
and offer tailored solutions to promote healthier actions. The encoun-
ter can be useful to review patient self-monitoring records (digital or
written), accelerometer data, and diaries, or validated questionnaires
on physical activity.
Guideline-directed medications are key to the effective management of
CCS and prevention of subsequent cardiovascular events, but depend-
ent on patient adherence and persistence with treatment. Despite ro-
bust evidence of benefits in terms of mortality and morbidity,1150
adherence remains suboptimal.1151 Although adherence is usually high-
er in RCTs, approximately 28% of CCS patients in the ISCHEMIA trial
were
non-adherent
to
prescribed
medications
at
baseline.1152
Non-adherence was associated with significantly worse health status
regardless of randomization to the conservative or invasive strat-
egy.1152 Medication adherence can be intentional or unintentional,
and can be adversely affected by polypharmacy, complex drug regi-
mens, high cost, and side effects.
Improving adherence to medications has proved challenging.1153 One
systematic review and meta-analysis (771 studies to 2015) found that
interventions that were behaviourally focused, e.g. linking medication-
taking to existing habits, were more effective than those that were
cognitively focused.1154 A systematic review of 17 trials of adherence
for secondary CVD prevention found that a short message service, a
fixed-dose combination pill, and a community health worker-based
intervention (one trial each) increased adherence compared with
usual care.1155 Behavioural and mixed behavioural/educational inter-
ventions improved adherence in older adults with multiple medica-
tions (low-quality evidence), with little evidence for educational-only
interventions.1156 Drug reminder packaging—i.e. incorporating the
date and time for the medication to be taken in a package (pre-filled
containers)—can act as a prompt, with some evidence that it in-
creases pills taken and improves diastolic BP and HbA1c levels.1157
Treating depression is important, as depression was associated with
reduced adequate and optimal adherence to recommended medica-
tions 12 months post-PCI in an analysis of 124 443 patients.1158
Simplifying medication regimens using fixed-dose polypills has been
shown to increase adherence.1159–1162 The SECURE trial demon-
strated that patients 6 months post-MI randomized to a polypill con-
taining aspirin, ramipril, and atorvastatin had significantly lower MACE
and were more likely to have high adherence at 6 and 24 months com-
pared with the usual care group.1163
A review of mobile phone text messaging found promising, if limited,
evidence that such messaging could improve medication adherence
up to 12 months after acute coronary events.1164 Similarly, another re-
view of 24 studies of text messages and/or apps found robust evidence
for adherence to pharmacological therapy.1146 A pilot trial of 135
non-adherent patients with hypertension and/or diabetes randomized
patients to a highly tailored digital intervention (text messages and
interactive voice response) or usual care for 12 weeks. Medication
adherence was significantly improved in the intervention group, along
with improvements in systolic BP and HbA1c, compared with the con-
trol group.1165
Long-term follow-up of patients with CCS who have either established
CAD (prior acute MI, revascularization, known CAD) or non-
obstructive CAD includes surveillance for disease progression.
However, current literature is sparse regarding mode, frequency, and
duration. Follow-up of patients is based on their clinical condition,
which includes cardiovascular risk factors, residual symptoms, cardiac
complications [such as post-infarction LV remodelling and dysfunction,
associated mitral regurgitation (mostly functional), known HF, signifi-
cant arrhythmias], and non-cardiac comorbidities like PAD, stroke,
and renal dysfunction.
The main goal of follow-up is to determine the patient’s risk of
developing new cardiac events through risk stratification and to
identify symptoms suggestive of CAD progression. A second goal is

to promptly diagnose and manage extracoronary complications, such as
the onset of HF, arrhythmias, and valvular dysfunction. Additionally,
during long-term follow-up, antianginal and disease-modifying medica-
tion should be optimized and adjusted based on the development of co-
morbidities. The potential benefits vs. bleeding risks of antithrombotic
drugs should be considered and evaluated over time.
Although assessing the anginal status is traditionally considered the
cornerstone of clinical follow-up, it is worth noting that angina resolves
in 40% of CCS patients at 1 year with further annual decreases, most
often without revascularization or adaptation of antianginal therapy.404
In contrast to patients with resolving symptoms, those with persistent
or recurrent angina are at higher risk of cardiovascular death or MI.404
The worse prognosis of persisting angina, however, was only observed
in patients with a previous MI.408
disease events
Patients with established ASCVD are at high risk of recurrent events
and different risk factors have been identified. The REACH registry de-
monstrated that, in addition to the traditional risk factors, the burden of
disease, lack of treatment, and geographical location are all related to an
increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CCS patients
and validated a risk score that allows estimation of the risk for
MACE.1167 Using data from stabilized CCS patients from 27
European countries included in the EUROASPIRE IV and V surveys, a
new risk model with an online risk calculator to predict recurrent
CVD events in patients under the age of 75 years was developed and
externally validated in the SWEDEHEART registry.1168,1169 This model
indicated that the risk of recurrent MACE is mainly driven by comorbid-
ities including diabetes, renal insufficiency, and dyslipidaemia, but also
symptoms of depression and anxiety. A study of patients with estab-
lished CAD from the UK Biobank confirmed the value of classical risk
factors, lifestyle, and sociodemographic factors in predicting recurrent
MACE.1170 In addition, it was found that high genetic predisposition to
CAD, low HDL-C, and younger age at first ACS event most strongly
predicted the recurrence risk. A polygenic risk score, when added to
the Framingham score, improved predictions of events in a large popu-
lation in the USA.1171 Although the prediction of recurrent MACE has
been refined, it must be emphasized that the predictive power of the
different risk factors is weak and that a significant part of recurrent
MACE in CCS patients remains unexplained. Furthermore, the models
do not incorporate information on LV function, HF, concomitant valvu-
lar disease, atherosclerotic disease burden in other vascular beds, or the
severity of existing CAD.1172 While risk factors for recurrent cardiac
events have been established, no clinical studies have tested predefined
clinical pathways for long-term follow-up of various types of CCS pa-
tients. As a result, the long-term clinical follow-up of CCS patients is
primarily empirical, based on good clinical judgement, and on the
same criteria used in the initial diagnostic process to define high risk
of adverse events (Section 3.3.5 and Figure 18).
When scheduling long-term follow-up for CCS patients with recurring
or worsening angina, it is important to consider factors such as patient
type, the presence of risk factors, availability of diagnostic techniques,
and cost-effectiveness following regional or national healthcare policies.
Different CCS phenotypes may develop or recur during long-term
follow-up, altering the follow-up needed over time. The intervals and
examination methods during long-term follow-up may vary based on
the CCS phenotype, coronary atherosclerotic burden, presence of
CMD, and severity of ischaemic LV dysfunction.
A stepwise approach based on risk assessment can be followed, like
that applied for diagnosing and treating individuals with suspected CCS.
Step 1: This involves an annual clinical evaluation, by a general prac-
titioner or a cardiologist, encompassing symptom evaluation, medica-
tion review, physical examination, a resting 12-lead ECG, and blood
tests for lipid profile, renal function, glycaemic status, and full blood
count. The ECG should be scrutinized for heart rate, rhythm, evidence
of silent ischaemia/infarction, and evaluation of PR, QRS, and QT inter-
vals. Any new symptoms suggestive of ACS, especially with ECG
agement of patients with acute coronary syndromes. 65 Current med-
ical therapy and lifestyle measures for risk-factor control can be
maintained or optimized for asymptomatic patients.
Step 2: If CCS patients develop new or worsening angina or HF
symptoms, arrhythmias or ECG changes, further cardiac evaluation is
crucial, especially if symptoms persist despite optimized GDMT.
Recurrent CAD event risk should be assessed based on symptoms,
progression
of
risk
factors,
and
resting
ECG
changes.
Echocardiography may be performed to assess LV function, cardiac di-
mensions, and valvular abnormalities. Exercise ECG testing may be con-
sidered to confirm symptoms and evaluate functional capacity if it alters
patient management. However, routine functional testing is not recom-
mended for asymptomatic post-PCI patients, as it has not been shown
to improve outcomes compared with standard care after 2 years.1173
Step 3: CCS patients with persistent symptoms at low exercise levels
despite optimized GDMT or unexpectedly reduced LV function, espe-
cially with regional contraction abnormalities, need further cardiac test-
ing to detect the progression of CAD and assess the event risk.
For patients with known non-obstructive CAD, CCTA can help
detect new obstructive stenoses, evaluate atherosclerotic disease pro-
gression, and identify high-risk plaque features, while functional imaging
is reasonable for detecting myocardial ischaemia and guiding further
management. In patients with ANOCA/INOCA and stratified medical
therapy, CCTA can be useful to detect new or progressing CAD.
For patients with obstructive CAD or previous cardiac events, non-
invasive functional imaging is the preferred method to detect and quan-
tify myocardial ischaemia and/or scar. However, in patients with severe-
ly limiting angina and known severe ischaemia on functional testing or
high-risk CAD on CCTA, direct referral to ICA for revascularization
is preferred due to the very high risk of recurrent CAD events.
Although CCTA can detect CABG graft patency and exclude in-stent
restenosis (ISR) in broad lumen arteries, functional imaging is preferred
for assessing patients with prior revascularization because of the high
frequency of extensive CAD in these patients.1174–1176
Step 4: In all patients with recurrent or worsening anginal symptoms,
lifestyle modifications, risk-factor management, and GDMT should be
intensified before considering further interventions. For patients with
significant inducible myocardial ischaemia or high-risk CAD, and persist-
ent anginal symptoms despite lifestyle modifications and intensified
GDMT, repeat coronary revascularization may be necessary to alleviate
symptoms and improve prognosis. For patients with prior CABG ex-
periencing stable symptoms, it’s important to optimize GDMT when-
ever possible. If frequent angina persists despite GDMT optimization,
ICA or CCTA can assist in guiding treatment decisions.1177–1179
When symptoms are uncertain, functional testing may help clarify the
presence and extent of myocardial ischaemia.
All non-invasive diagnostic testing, including CCTA, stress SPECT,
or PET myocardial perfusion imaging, stress echocardiography,
and stress CMR have been shown to provide prognostic informa-
tion in patients with established CAD.296,1180,1181 Anatomical im-
aging with CCTA has the advantage of providing information on
left main disease and graft patency. Stress imaging provides informa-
tion on the degree of ischaemia, which helps guide an appropriate
management
plan.
For
example,
symptomatic
patients
with
moderate-to-severe myocardial ischaemia despite GDMT will usu-
ally undergo additional revascularization. In patients with known
ANOCA/INOCA, non-invasive imaging with stress SPECT or PET
myocardial perfusion imaging, stress CMR, or stress echocardiog-
raphy remain first-line investigations, although the diagnostic yield
may be low;927 however, the current standard remains invasive cor-
onary functional testing.

revascularization failure
One in five revascularized patients needs a repeat revascularization
within the first 5 years after myocardial revascularization, with higher
risk after PCI compared with CABG.1182 Revascularization failure can
manifest either shortly after the initial procedure (within 30 days) or la-
ter on, and recurring symptoms may result from either restenosis of
the treated coronary segment or the failure of bypass grafts,772 along-
side the progression of underlying native CAD.1183,1184 Published evi-

Stent thrombosis and ISR are the most frequent reasons for PCI failure.
Stent thrombosis occurs infrequently and is multifactorial. Anatomical
and mechanical factors, as well as lack of adherence or hyporesponsive-
ness to antiplatelet treatment, are frequently the reasons behind
this.1182,1185 The majority of patients with stent thrombosis present
with ACS and should be treated according to the 2023 ESC
Guidelines for the management of patients with acute coronary syn-
dromes.65 Urgent ICA to confirm diagnosis and treatment is indicated.
After restoration of coronary flow, intracoronary imaging to identify
mechanical failure should be performed. Repeated DES implantation
is indicated in case of stent fracture or collapse and residual edge dissec-
tions, while high-pressure non-compliant balloon dilation is indicated in
case of stent under-expansion or malapposition.
In-stent restenosis results as a response to vessel wall injury
(neointimal hyperplasia) or neoatherosclerosis in the stented segment
of the coronary artery. Although significantly less frequent than after
bare-metal stent implantation, the incidence of clinical in-DES restenosis
is up to 10% within the first 10 years after DES implantation1182 and re-
mains the most frequent cause of PCI failure. The clinical presentation
of ISR is mostly CCS, with 20% ACS, and the remaining asymptomatic.
The indication to treat ISR is like that for native CAD. Radiological stent
enhancement and intracoronary imaging are encouraged to determine
the ISR mechanism. PCI treatment of ISR should be focused on the
stenotic segment. Lesion preparation (ultra-high pressure balloon dila-
tion, intravascular lithotripsy, rotation atherectomy) and correction of
mechanical issues are required.1182 Thereafter, drug-coated balloon
angioplasty or DES implantation is necessary.1186,1187 Drug-eluting bal-
loon angioplasty and repeat stenting with DES were equally effective
and safe in treating bare-metal ISR, but drug-coated balloon angioplasty
was less effective than repeat paclitaxel DES implantation in treating
DES ISR.1186 However, at 10-year follow-up there was no difference
in clinical endpoints between drug-coated balloon angioplasty and
DES implantation, whereas both were more effective than balloon
angioplasty
in
preventing
target-lesion
revascularization.1187
Everolimus DES was associated with better long-term outcomes than
drug-coated balloons.1188
bypass grafting
A variety of reasons have the potential to adversely affect bypass graft
patency.1189 These include technical (quality of graft material, surgical
precision) and pathophysiological aspects (competitive flow, activity
of the coagulation system, disease progression, etc.). Technical aspects
and competitive flow are thought to influence early graft failure, while
disease
progression
and
graft
degeneration
affect
long-term
patency.1182,1189
The majority of graft occlusions are clinically silent.1189 If symptoms
occur, prompt diagnostic workup (including ECG, assessment of bio-
markers, and possibly repeat coronary angiography) is warranted to
limit or prevent potential damage from graft occlusion.316 Acute
CABG graft failure (<1 month after surgery) is observed in approxi-
mately 12% of grafts mostly due to technical problems.1190 Late failure
of saphenous vein grafts occurs in up to 50% at 10 years, with vein graft
occlusion rates in up to 27% within 1 year after surgery. 771,1191
The decision for optimal treatment (conservative, CABG revision/
redo CABG or PCI of the native vessel or of the failed graft) should
be made individually considering haemodynamic stability, technical

If re-operation is required, the surgical risk is generally in-
creased.1182,1192 If acute re-operation is required, acute ischaemia is
generally present, and adhesions and the presence of patent grafts in-
crease the complexity of the procedure. It is, therefore, important to
weigh this risk against the expected benefit. Since a patent left internal
thoracic artery (LITA) to the LAD confers the largest part of CABG
prognostic potential,1189,1194 redo CABG is primarily recommended

LITA was not used during the first operation.772
angina/ischaemia
An ageing population and an increased survival rate in patients with
CAD due to improvements in anti-ischaemic medical therapy and cor-
onary revascularization have led to a growing number of patients with
severe and diffuse CAD not amenable to further revascularization pro-
cedures. Despite the use of antianginal drugs and/or PCI or CABG, the
proportion of patients with CAD who have daily or weekly angina
ranges from 2% to 24%.555
Refractory angina is defined as long-lasting symptoms (for >3 months)
due to established reversible ischaemia: (i) in the presence of ob-
structive CAD, which cannot be controlled by escalating medical ther-
apy with additional antianginal drugs, bypass grafting, or PCI including
recanalization of chronic total coronary occlusion; or (ii) due to
ANOCA/INOCA. In the case of ANOCA/INOCA, further investiga-
tions are required to define the different endotypes (Section 4.4.2) and
appropriate treatment (Section 6.3) before diagnosing refractory
angina.36
The QoL of patients with refractory angina is poor, with frequent
hospitalization and a high level of resource utilization.555 Once conven-
tional anti-ischaemic targets have been exhausted, novel therapies can
be ranked by mechanism of action, promotion of collateral growth,
transmural redistribution of blood flow, and neuromodulation of the
cardiac pain syndrome.
Considering the chronic nature of the disease and according to risk–
benefit assessments, among the currently available options, the most
promising and easily implementable in everyday clinical practice are en-
hanced external counterpulsation and the coronary sinus reducer de-
vice,555 after all medical therapy and mechanical revascularization
options have been exhausted (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4). Enhanced ex-
ternal counterpulsation has been shown to ameliorate refractory an-
gina in several trials.1198
The coronary sinus reducer consists of controlled coronary sinus
narrowing with the implantation of a large stainless-steel device to in-
crease coronary sinus pressure and improve perfusion in the LAD ter-
ritory.1199 In a recent meta-analysis including eight registries and one
RCT, in a total of 846 patients with refractory angina, use of a coronary
sinus reducer led to improvement of ≥1 CCS class in 76% (95% CI,
(95% CI, 35%–46%) of patients.1200 The Coronary Sinus Reducer
Objective Impact on Symptoms, MRI Ischaemia and Microvascular
Resistance (ORBITA-COSMIC) trial, a small proof-of-concept RCT,
found no evidence that implantation of a coronary sinus reducer im-
proved transmural myocardial perfusion, but it was associated with im-
proved angina symptoms compared with placebo. 1201
There are several ongoing RCTs evaluating the use of coronary
sinus reducer in ANOCA/INOCA, such as COronary SInus Reducer
for the Treatment of Refractory Microvascular Angina (COSIMA;
NCT04606459), and the Efficacy of the COronary SInus Reducer in
Patients with Refractory Angina II (COSIRA-II; NCT05102019).
A variety of new pharmacological approaches is becoming available
and includes angiogenetic therapies with vascular endothelial growth
factors and fibroblast growth factors, as well as stem cell therapy
with intramyocardial delivery of CD34+ cells.1202,1203 However, further
RCTs are needed to validate the feasibility of such therapeutic
strategies.
To date, the main limitations of reported experiences with all novel
therapeutic options regard the small number of treated patients and
the duration of follow-up. Larger sham-controlled RCTs are required
to define the role of each treatment modality for specific subgroups,
and ultimately to aim at the best possible personalized treatment algo-
rithm, based on aetiology stratification, and escalation of available thera-
peutic modalities.

Patients with CCS who develop LV dysfunction may experience ad-
vanced HF, malignant arrhythmias and secondary valvular heart disease
(i.e. mitral and tricuspid regurgitation).
Prior MI and ischaemic aetiology are negative prognostic markers in
patients with advanced HF,1205 as well as in those with secondary mitral
regurgitation.1206 Specific treatments need to be considered in these
patients regardless of HF aetiology (i.e. ischaemic).526 Advanced HF
treatments include: high diuretic doses; a combination of diuretics
and renal replacement therapy to treat congestion; inotropic and vaso-
pressor agents to reduce hypoperfusion; and mechanical circulatory
support in selected patients with severe symptoms or exercise intoler-
ance, despite optimal medical therapies, and without right ventricular
dysfunction. Heart transplantation is recommended for patients with
advanced HF, refractory to medical/device therapy, and who do not
have absolute contraindications. Early evaluation for mechanical circu-
latory supports or heart transplantation is currently suggested also in
patients with mild symptoms [i.e. New York Heart Association
(NYHA) class II] and high-risk profile (i.e. LVEF of <20%, recurrent
HF events, hypotension, intolerance to medical therapy, worsening or-
gan failure, ventricular arrhythmias/ICD shock).526
An ICD is recommended in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy
and LVEF of <35% or who have recovered from ventricular arrhyth-
mias.526 Frequent, symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias in ICD recipi-
ents should be treated medically with either beta-blockers or
amiodarone. In patients with CCS who develop ventricular fibrillation
or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, assessment for myocardial is-
chaemia should be performed without delay. In patients with CAD in
whom sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia recurs while
on amiodarone treatment, catheter ablation is recommended over
the escalation of antiarrhythmic drugs.1207 Percutaneous treatment
of secondary mitral regurgitation in patients with advanced HF may
be considered to improve symptoms.526 Treatment of secondary tri-
cuspid regurgitation in advanced stages of disease was, until recently,
supported by limited evidence.1208 Percutaneous tricuspid transcath-

I
A
In CCS patients with preserved LVEF, no diabetes, insufficient response to guideline-directed medical therapy, and significant three-vessel
disease of low-to-intermediate anatomic complexity in whom PCI can provide similar completeness of revascularization to that of CABG,

Recommendations for management of chronic coronary syndrome patients with chronic heart failure
Managing CCS in heart failure patients
In HF patients with LVEF ≤35% in whom obstructive CAD is suspected, ICA is recommended with a view towards improving prognosis by
CABG, taking into account the risk-to-benefit ratio of the procedures.
I
B
In HF patients with LVEF >35% and suspected CCS with low or moderate (>5%–50%) pre-test likelihood of obstructive CAD, CCTA or
functional imaging is recommended.
I

Managing heart failure in CCS patients
It is recommended that CCS patients with HF be enrolled in a multidisciplinary HF management programme to reduce the risk of HF
hospitalization and to improve survival.
I

An ICD is recommended to reduce the risk of sudden death and all-cause mortality in patients with symptomatic HF (NYHA class II–III) of
ischaemic aetiology (unless they have had an MI in the prior 40 days), and an LVEF ≤35% despite ≥3 months of optimized GDMT, provided
they are expected to survive substantially longer than 1 year with good functional status.
